            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

         <div type="introduction">
            <head>Introduction to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THis Tract was Written chiefly to ſatisfie my own Curioſity, and
to delight my ſelf with the Memory of what I had ſeen. I buſied my ſelf
in a place where I had little to do, but to walk up and down; well knowing,
that the Character of a Stranger gave me free admittance to Men and Things. The
French Nation value themſelves upon Civility, and build and dreſs moſtly
for Figure; This Humour <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61013:8"/>makes the Curioſity of Strangers
very eaſie and welcome to them.</p>
            <p>But why do you trouble us with a Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> a place
ſo well known to every body here? For very good Reaſon, to ſpare the
often telling my Tale at my return. But we know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready all you can ſay, or
can read it in the <hi>Preſent State of France,</hi> and <hi>Deſcription of
Paris;</hi> two Books to be had in every Shop in <hi>London;</hi> 'Tis right,
ſo you may; and I adviſe you not to neglect them, if you have a mind to
judge well of the Grandeur of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and the immenſe
Greatneſs of the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> Theſe were Spectacles I did
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed put on, but I found they did not fit my ſight, I had a mind to ſee
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; and in Matters of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as vaſt Cities and vaſt
Palaces, I did not care much to uſe Microſcopes or Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
Glaſſes.</p>
            <p>But to content you, Reader, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you not to trouble you with
Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies either of State or Church, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks; for I entred willingly
into nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, but only, where they would make a part of the
Converſation, or my Walk was ordered me. You'l eaſily find by my
Obſervations, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline rather to Nature than Dominion; 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61013:8"/>and that I took more pleaſure to ſee Monſieur
<hi>Breman</hi> in his white Waſtcoat digging in the Royal Phyſick Garden,
and ſowing his Couches, than Monſieur <hi>Saintot</hi> making room for an
Ambaſſador; and I found my ſelf better diſpoſed, and more apt to
learn the Names and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy of a Hundred Plants, than of 5 or 6 Princes.
After all, I had much rather have walked a 100 paces under the meaneſt Hedge
in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> than any the fineſt Alley at <hi>Verſailles</hi> or
<hi>St. Clou,</hi> ſo much I prefer fair Nature and a warm Sun, before the
moſt exquiſite perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of Art in a cold and barren Climate.</p>
            <p>Another Reaſon, that I give you little or no trouble in telling
you Court Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is, that I was no more concerned in the Embaſſy, than
in the ſailing of the Ship which carried me over: 'Tis enough for me, with
the reſt of the People of <hi>England,</hi> to feel the good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it,
and to paſs away this Life in Peace and Quietneſs. 'Tis a happy turn for
us, when Kings are made Friends again. This was the end of this Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
and I hope it will laſt our days. My Lord Ambaſſador was infinitely
careſſed by the King, his Miniſters, and all the Princes. 'Tis certain
the French are the <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61013:9"/>moſt Polite Nation in the World, and can
Praiſe and Court with a better Air than the reſt of Mankind. However the
generality of the Kingdom were through great neceſſity well diſpoſed to
receive the Peace: The Bigots and ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded Officers might be heard
at our firſt going to grumble, but thoſe alſo gave over, and we heard no
more of them when we came away; but to the Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>I happily arrived at <hi>Paris</hi> after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Journey in very
bad Weather; for we ſet out of <hi>London</hi> the 10th of <hi>December,</hi>
and I did not reach <hi>Paris</hi> till the firſt of <hi>January;</hi> for I
fell ſick upon the Road, and ſtay'd 5 days at <hi>Bologne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the
Company, till my Fever abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet notwithſtanding ſo rude a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I
recovered, and was perfectly cured of my Cough in 10 days; which was the
chiefeſt reaſon of my leaving <hi>London</hi> at that time of the year, and
never had the leaſt return of it all the Winter, though it was as fierce
there as I ever felt it in <hi>England.</hi> This great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the
<hi>French</hi> Air I had experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced 3 ſeveral times before, and had
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore long'd for a paſſage many years; but the continuance of the War
was an inſuperable Obſtacle to my Deſires. <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61013:9"/>Therefore
the firſt opportunity which offered it ſelf I readily embraced, which was
my Lord <hi>Portland</hi>'s Acceptance of my Attendance of him in his
Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Embaſſie; who ordered me to go before with one of my good
Friends, who was ſent to prepare Matters againſt his arrival.</p>
            <p>Now that I might not wholly truſt my Memory, in what I ſaw at
<hi>Paris,</hi> I ſet down my Thoughts under certain Heads.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="section">
            <head>I. Of <hi>Paris</hi> in General.</head>
            <p>THough I had much ſpare time the 6 Months I ſtaid in that City,
yet the rudeneſs of the Winter Seaſon kept me in for ſome time. Again, I
believe I did not ſee the Tithe of what deſerves to be ſeen, and well
conſidered; becauſe for many things I wanted a reliſh, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for
Painting and Building; However I viewed the City in all its parts, and made the
round of it; took ſeveral proſpects of it at a diſtance, which when well
thought on, I muſt needs confeſs it to be one of the moſt Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and
Magnificent in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in which a Traveller might find Novelties

               </gap> leaſt in and
about this <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61013:10"/>Noble City. To give therefore a ſtrict and
general Idea of it, and not to enter far into the vain Diſputes of the number
of Inhabitants, or its bigneſs, compared to <hi>London;</hi> ſure I am, the
<hi>ſtanding Croud</hi> was ſo great, when my Lord Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor made his
Entry, that our People were ſtrartled at it, and were ready the next day to
give up the Queſtion, had they not well conſidered the great Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
of the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> who are much more delighted in fine Shews than the
People of <hi>London,</hi> and ſo were well near all got into the way of the
Cavalcade. One thing was an evident Argument of this Humour, that there were
ſome Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Coaches of Perſons of the beſt Quality, even ſome
Biſhops and Peers which I ſaw, which had placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a file to
line the Streets, and had had the patience to have ſo remained for ſome
hours.</p>
            <p>'Tis alſo moſt certain, that for the quantity of Ground
poſſeſſed by the Common People, this City is much more populous than
any part of <hi>London;</hi> here are from 4 to 5 and to 10 Menages, or
diſtinct Families in many Houſes; but this is only to be underſtood of
certain places of Trade. This difference betwixt the two Cities alſo is true,
that here the <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61013:10"/>Palaces and Convents have eat up the Peoples
Dwellings, and crouded them exceſſively together, and poſſeſſed
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of far the greateſt part of the Ground; whereas in
<hi>London</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary may be obſerved, that the People have
deſtroyed the Palaces, and placed themſelves upon the Foundations of them,
and forced the Nobility to live in Squares or Streets in a ſort of
Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but this they have done very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, having fairly purchaſed
them.</p>
            <p>The Views alſo which it gives upon the River are admirable; that
of the <hi>Pont-neuf</hi> downwards to the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> or upwards from
the <hi>Pont-Royal;</hi> and in ſome other places, as from <hi>Pont St.
Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> the <hi>Greve, &amp;c.</hi> The River <hi>Seine</hi> which
paſſes through the midſt of the City, is all nobly Bank'd or Keyed with
large Freeſtone; and incloſes in the heart of the City two Iſlands, which
cauſes many fine Bridges to be built to paſs over them. One of theſe
Iſlands called <hi>l'Iſle de Palais</hi> was all <hi>Paris</hi> for ſome
Ages.</p>
            <p>The Houſes are built of hewen Stone intirely, or whited over with
Plaiſter: ſome indeed in the beginning of this Age are of Brick with
Freeſtone, as the <hi>Place-Royal, Place-Dauphin, &amp;c.</hi> but that is 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61013:11"/>wholly left off now; and the white Plaiſter is in ſome
few places only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured after the faſhion of Brick, as part of the Abbay of
<hi>St. Germain.</hi> The Houſes every where are high and ſtately; The
Churches numerous, but not very big; The Towers and Steeples but few in
proportion to the Churches, yet that noble way of Steeple, the <hi>Domes</hi>
or <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polas,</hi> have a marvellous effect in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; though they are
not many, as that of <hi>Val de Grace, des Invalides, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege Mazarin, De
l'Aſſumption,</hi> the <hi>Grand-Jeſuits, La Sorbonne,</hi> and ſome
few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>All the Houſes of Perſons of Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are built with
<hi>Port-cochers,</hi> that is, wide Gates to drive in a Coach, and
conſequently have Courts within; and moſtly <hi>Remiſes</hi> to ſet
them up. There are reckoned above 700 of theſe great Gates; and very many of
theſe are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the moſt noble Patterns of ancient Architecture.</p>
            <p>The lower Windows of all Houſes are Grated with ſtrong Bars of
Iron; which muſt be a vaſt Expence.</p>
            <p>As the Houſes are magnificent without, ſo the Finiſhing within
ſide and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture anſwer in Riches and Neatneſs; as Hangings of rich
Tapeſtry, raiſed with <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61013:11"/>Gold and Silver Threads, Crimſon
Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask and Velvet Beds or of Gold and Silver Tiſſue. <hi>Cabinets</hi> and
<hi>Bureaus,</hi> of Ivory inlaid with Tortoiſhell, and Gold and Silver
Plates in a 100 different manners: Branches and Candleſticks of Cryſtal:
but above all moſt rare Pictures. The Gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Carvings and Paintings of
the Roof are admirable.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are in this City and the Country about to ſuch a
variety and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that you can come into no private Houſe of any Man of
Subſtance, but you ſee ſomething of them; and they are obſerved
frequently to ruine themſelves in theſe Expences. Every one, that has any
thing to ſpare, covets to have ſome good Picture or Sculpture of the beſt
Artiſt; The like in the Ornaments of their Gardens, ſo that it is
incredible what pleaſure that vaſt quantity of fine things give the Curious
Stranger. Here as ſoon as ever a Man gets any thing by Fortune or
Inheritance, he lays it out in ſome ſuch way as now named.</p>
            <p>Yet after all many Utenſils and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of Life are wanting
here, which we in <hi>England</hi> have: This makes me remember what Monſieur
<hi>Juſtell,</hi> a <hi>Pariſian</hi> formerly, told me here, that he had
made a Catalogue of near Threeſcore <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61013:12"/>Things of this Nature
which they wanted in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pavement of the Streets is all of ſquare Stone, of about 8 or
10 Inches thick; that is, as deep in the ground as they are broad at top; The
Gutters ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and laid round without edges, which makes the Coaches glide
eaſily over them.</p>
            <p>However, it muſt needs be ſaid, the Streets are very narrow, and
the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers a-foot no ways ſecured from the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and danger of
Coaches, which always paſs the Streets with an air of haſte; and a full
trot upon broad flat Stones, betwixt high and large reſounding Houſes,
makes a ſort of Muſick which ſhould ſeem very agreeable to the
<hi>Pariſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Royal Palaces are ſurpriſingly ſtately; as the
<hi>Louvre</hi> and <hi>Tuilliries, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais Luxembourg, Palais Royal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Convents are great, and numerous, and well built; as <hi>Val de
Grace, St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, St. Victor, St. Genevieve,</hi> the <hi>Grand Jeſuits,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Squares are few in <hi>Paris,</hi> but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beautiful; as the
<hi>Place Royal, Place Victoir, Place Dauphine,</hi> none of the largeſt,
except the <hi>Place Vendoſme,</hi> not yet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61013:12"/>The Gardens within the Walls, open to the
publick, are vaſtly great, and very beautiful; as the <hi>Tuilleries, Palais
Royal, Luxembourg,</hi> the <hi>Royal Phyſick Garden,</hi> of the
<hi>Arſenal,</hi> and many belonging to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, the <hi>Carthuſians,
Celeſtins, St. Victor, St. Genevieve, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which makes the dwelling in this City very diverting for
People of Quality, is the facility of going out with their Coaches into the
Fields, on every ſide; it lying round, and the Avenues to it ſo well paved;
and the Places of Airing ſo clean, open, or ſhady, as you pleaſe, or the
Seaſon of the year, and time of the day requires: As the <hi>Cour de la
Reyne, Bois de Bologne, Bois de Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennes, les Sables de Vaugerarde,
&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to deſcend to a more particular Review of this great City, I
think it not amiſs to ſpeak firſt of the Streets and publick Places, and
what may be ſeen in them: Next of the Houſes of Note; and what
Curioſities of Nature or Art, alſo of Men and Libraries, I met with: Next,
of their Diet and Recreations: Next of the Gardens, and their Furniture and
Ornaments: Of the Air and Health. We ſhall conclude the whole with the
preſent State of Phyſic and Pharmacy here.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Coaches.</note>To begin with the Coaches, which
are very numerous here and very fine in Gilding: But there are but few, and
thoſe only of the great Nobility, which are large, and have two Seats or
Funds. But what they want in the largeneſs, beauty, and neatneſs of ours in
<hi>London,</hi> they have infinitely in the eaſineſs of Carriage, and the
ready turning in the narroweſt Streets. For this purpoſe, they are all
Crane-Neckt, and the Wheels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very low, not above two foot and a half
Diameter; which makes them ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to get into, and brings down the Coach-Box
low, that you have a much better proſpect out of the foremoſt Glaſs; our
high ſeated Coachmen being ever in the point of view. Again, They are moſt,
even Fiacres or Hackneys, hung with <hi>Double Springs,</hi> at the four
Corners, which inſenſibly breaks all Jolts. This I never was ſo
ſenſible off, as after having pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the <hi>Paris</hi> Coaches for
four months, I once rid in the eaſieſt Chariot of my Lords, which came from
<hi>England;</hi> but not a Jolt but what affected a Man; ſo as to be tired
more in one hour in that, than in ſix in theſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides the great number of Coaches of the Gentry, here are
Coaches <hi>de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> 
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61013:13"/>by the month; which are very
well Guilt, neat Harneſs, and good Horſes: And theſe all Strangers Hire
by the Day or Month, at about Three Crowns Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a Day. 'Tis this ſort
that ſpoils the Hackneys and Chairs, which here are the moſt naſty and
miſerable Voiture that can be; and yet near as dear again as in
<hi>London,</hi> and but very few of them neither.</p>
            <p>Yet there is one more in this City, which I was willing to omit, as
thinking it at firſt fight Scandalous, and a very Jeſt; it being a wretched
Buſineſs in ſo Magnificent a City; and that is, the <hi>Vinegrette,</hi>
a Coach on Two Wheels, dragg'd by a Man, and puſh'd behind by a Woman or Boy,
or both.</p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe, for quick Travelling there are great number of
<hi>Poſt-Chaiſes</hi> for a ſingle Perſon; and <hi>Roullions</hi> for
two Perſons: Theſe are on two Wheels only, and have each their Double
Springs to make them very eaſie; they run very ſwiftly: both the Horſes
pull; but one only is in the Thilles. The Coach-man mounts the
<hi>Roullion;</hi> but for the <hi>Chaiſe,</hi> he only mounts the ſide
Horſe only. I think neither of theſe are in uſe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but
might be introduced to good purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61013:14"/>
               <note place="margin">Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and
Walks.</note>As for their <hi>Recreations and Walks,</hi> there are no People
more fond of coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſee and to be ſeen. This Converſation
without doubt takes up a great part of their time: And for this purpoſe, the
<hi>Cour de la Reyne</hi> is frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all People of Quality. It is a
Treble Walk of Trees of a great length, near the River ſide, the middle Walk
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving above double the breadth to the two ſide ones; and will hold eight
files of Coaches, and in the middle a great open Circle to turn, with fine
Gates at both ends. Thoſe that would have better and freer Air, go further,
and drive into the <hi>Bois de Bologne,</hi> others out of other Parts of the
Town to <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> ſcarce any ſide amiſs. In like manner
theſe Perſons light and Walk in the <hi>Tuilleries, Luxembourg,</hi> and
other Gardens, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown and Princes, (all which are very
ſpacious) and are made conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, with <hi>many Seats</hi> for the
Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of all People; the Lacquies and Mob excepted; but of this more
here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Biſhops.</note>No ſort of People make a
better figure in the Town than the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who have very ſplendid
Equipages, and variety of fine Liveries, being moſt of them Men of 
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61013:14"/>great Families, and preferred as ſuch, Learning not being
ſo neceſſary a Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for thoſe Dignities, as with us; tho'
there are ſome of them very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and Learned Men. I ſay, They are
moſt Noblemen, or the younger Sons of the beſt Families. This indeed, is
for the Honour of the Church; but whether it be for the good of Learning and
Piety is doubtful. They may be Patrons, but there are but few Examples of
Erudition among them. 'Tis to be wiſht, that they exceeded others in Merit,
as they do in Birth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Abbots.</note>The <hi>Abbots</hi> here are
numerous, from all Parts of the Kingdom. They make a conſiderable figure, as
being a gentile ſort of Clergy, and the moſt Learned; at leaſt were ſo
from the time of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who preferred Men of the
greateſt Learning and Parts to theſe Poſts; and that very frankly, and
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their knowing it before-hand, much leſs ſolliciting him for it. He
took a ſure way, peculiar to himſelf, to enquire out privately Men of
Deſert, and took his own time to prefer them. This filled the Kingdom of
<hi>France</hi> with learned Men, and gave great Encouragement to Study;
whereof <hi>France</hi> yet has ſome feeling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61013:15"/>
               <note place="margin">Signs in the
Streets.</note>'Tis pretty to obſerve, how the King Diſciplines this great
City, by ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Obedience. He cauſed them to take down all
their Signs at once, and not to advance them above a foot or two from the Wall,
nor to exceed ſuch a ſmall meaſure of ſquare; which was readily done:
So that the Signs obſcure not the Streets at all, and make little or no
figure, as tho' there were none; being placed very high and little.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Hoſtels.</note>There are great number of
<hi>Hoſtels</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> by which word is meant <hi>Publick
Inns,</hi> where Lodgings are Lett; and alſo the Noblemen and Gentlemens
Houſes are ſo called, moſtly with Titles over the Gate in Letters of Gold
on a Black Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This ſeems, as it were to denote, that they came at
firſt to <hi>Paris</hi> as Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers only, and Inn'd publickly; but at
length built them Inns or Houſes of their own. 'Tis certain, a great and
wealthy City cannot be without People of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; nor ſuch a Court as that
of <hi>France</hi> without the daily Inſpection of what ſuch People do. But
whether the Country can ſpare them or not, I queſtion. The People of
<hi>England</hi> ſeem to have leſs Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and leſs Religion, where the
Gentry <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61013:15"/>have left them wholly to themſelves; and the Taxes
are raiſed with more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, inequality, and injuſtice, than when the
Landlords live upon the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The City rebuilt.</note>It may very well he, that
<hi>Paris</hi> is in a manner a new City within this 40 years. 'Tis certain
ſince this King came to the Crown, 'tis ſo much altered for the better,
that 'tis quite another thing; and if it be true what the Workmen told me, that
a common Houſe built of Rough Stone and Plaiſtered over, would not laſt
above 25 years, the greateſt part of the City has been lately rebuilt. In
this Age certainly moſt of the great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtels are built or re-edified; in
like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Convents, the Bridges and Churches, the Gates of the City; add
the great alteration of the Streets, the Keyes upon the River, the Pavements;
all theſe have had great additions, or are quite new.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Boats upon the River.</note>In the River
amongſt the Bridges, both above and below, are a vaſt number of Boats, of
Wood, Hay, Charcoal, Corn and Wine, and other Commodities. But when a ſudden
Thaw comes, they are often in danger of being ſplit and cruſht to pieces 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61013:16"/>upon the Bridges; which alſo are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ruined by
them. There have been great Loſſes to the Owners of ſuch Boats and
Goods.</p>
            <p>It has been propoſed to dig near the City a large <hi>Baſin</hi>
for a Winter Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but this has not had the face of Profit to the
Government; ſo they are ſtill left to execute their own Project. There are
no Laws or Projects ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al here, as what bring Profit to the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Farming is admirably well underſtood here.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Lawyers.</note>Amongſt the Living Objects to be
ſeen in the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Counſellors and Chief Officers
of the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice make a great Figure; They and their Wives have
their Trains carried up; ſo there are abundance to be ſeen walking about
the Streets in this manner. 'Tis for this that places of that nature ſell
ſo well. A Man that has a right to qualifie a Wife with this Honour, ſhall
command a Fortune; and the carrying a great Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Cuſhion to Church is
ſuch another buſineſs. The Place of a Lawyer is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued a Third part
dearer for this.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Monks.</note>Here are alſo daily to be ſeen
in the Streets great variety of <hi>Monks,</hi> in ſtrange 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61013:16"/>unuſual Habits to us <hi>Engliſhmen:</hi> Theſe make
an odd Figure, and furniſh well a Picture. I cannot but pity the miſtaken
Zeal of theſe poor Men; that put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Religion, as they call
it, and renounce the World, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt ſevere Rules of
Living and Diet; ſome of the Orders are decently enough Cloathed, as the
Jeſuits, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Oratory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but moſt are very
particular and obſolete in their Dreſs, as being the Ruſtic Habit of old
times, without Linnen, or Ornaments of the preſent Age.</p>
            <p>As to their Meager Diet, it is much againſt Nature, and the
improved Diet of Mankind. The <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law provided much better for
<hi>Jews,</hi> a choſen People; That was inſtituted for cleanlineſs and
health. Now for the Chriſtian Law, though it commands Humility and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
under Sufferings, and Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Abſtinence from Sinful Luſts and
Pleaſures; yet by no means a diſtinct Food, but liberty to eat any thing
what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, much leſs naſtineſs; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves in
other things are of this mind; for their Churches are clean, pompouſly
adorned and perfumed. 'Tis enough, if we chance to ſuffer Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to
endure it with Patience, and all <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61013:17"/>the miſerable
Circumſtances that attend it; but wantonly to perſecute our ſelves, is to
do violence to Chriſtianity, and to put our ſelves in a worſe ſtate
than the <hi>Jews</hi> were; for to chooſe the worſt of Food, which is
ſowre Herbs and Fiſh, and ſuch like Traſh, and to lie worſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
rough, in courſe and naſty Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Frocks upon Boards; To go Bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot in
a cold Country, to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Comforts of this Life, and the
Converſation of Men; This, I ſay, is to hazard our Healths, to renounce the
greateſt Bleſſings of this Life, and in a manner to deſtroy our
ſelves. Theſe Men, I ſay, cannot but be in the main Chagrin, and
therefore as they are out of humour with the World, ſo they muſt in time be
weary of ſuch ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and fruitleſs Devotion, which is not attended
with an active Life.</p>
            <p>The great multitude of <hi>poor</hi> Wretches in all parts of this
City is ſuch, that a Man in a Coach, a-foot, in the Shop, is not able to do
any buſineſs for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and importunities of Beggars; and to hear
their Miſeries is very lamentable; and if you give to one, you immediately
bring a whole ſwarm upon you. Theſe, I ſay, are true Monks, if you will,
of God Almighties making, offering you <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61013:17"/>their Prayers for a
Farthing, that find the evil of the day ſufficient for the day, and that the
Miſeries of this Life are not to be courted, or made a mock of; Theſe
Worſhip much againſt their will all rich Men, and make Saints of the reſt
of Mankind for a Morſel of Bread.</p>
            <p>But let theſe Men alone with their miſtaken Zeal; it is
certainly God's good Providence which orders all things in this World. And the
Fleſh Eaters will ever defend themſelves, if not beat the Lenten Men; good
and wholſome Food, and plenty of it, gives Men naturally great Courage.
Again, a Nation will ſooner be Peopled by the free Marriage of all ſorts of
People, than by the additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtealth of a few ſtarved Monks,
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them at any time to break their Vow. This limiting of Marriage
to a certain People only is a deduction and an abatement of Mankind, not leſs
in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt Country, than a conſtant War. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this leſſens alſo
the number of God's Worſhippers, inſtead of multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as the Stars
in the Firmament, or the Sand upon the Sea Shoar; Theſe Men wilfully cut off

               <note place="margin">Streets Lighted.</note>The Streets are lighted
alike all the Winter long, as well when the Moon ſhines, as at other times of
the Month; which I remember the rather, becauſe of the impertinent uſage of
our People at <hi>London,</hi> to take away the Lights for half of the Month,
as though the Moon was certain to ſhine and light the Streets, and that there
could be no Cloudy Weather in Winter. The Lanthorns here hang down in the very
middle of all the Streets, about 20 paces diſtance, and 20 foot high. They
are made of a ſquare of Glaſs about 2 foot deep, covered with a broad Plate
of Iron; and the Rope that lets them down, is ſecured and lockt up in an Iron
Funnel and little Trunk faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the Wall of the Houſe. Theſe
Lanthorns have Candles of 4 in the pound in them, which laſt burning till
after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</p>
            <p>As to theſe Lights, if any Man break them, he is forthwith ſent
to the Gallies; and there were 3 young Gentlemen of good Families, who were in
Priſon for having done it in a Frolick, and could <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61013:19"/>not be
releaſed thence in ſome Months; and that not without the diligent
Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of good Friends at Court.</p>

near 50000<hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> Sterling.</hi> This way of Lighting the Streets
is in uſe alſo in ſome other Cities in <hi>France.</hi> The King is
ſaid to have raiſed a large Tax by it. In the Preface to the Tax it is
ſaid, That conſidering the great danger his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were in, in Walking
the Streets in the Dark, from Thieves, and the breaking their Necks by falls,
he for ſuch a Sum of Money did grant this Priviledge, that they might hang
out Lanthorns in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Streets clean.</note>I have ſaid, that the
Avenues to the City, and all the Streets, are paved with a very hard <hi>Sand
Stone,</hi> about 8 Inches ſquare; ſo they have a great care to keep them
clean; in Winter, for Example, upon the melting of the Ice, by a heavy drag
with a Horſe, which makes a quick riddance and cleaning the Gutters; ſo
that in a days time all parts of the Town are to admiration clean and neat
again to walk on.</p>
            <p>I could heartily wiſh their <hi>Summer</hi> cleanlineſs was as
great; it is certainly as neceſſary to keep ſo populous a City 
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61013:19"/>ſweet; but I know no Machine ſufficient, but what would
empty it of the People too; all the Threats and Inſcriptions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Walls are
to little purpoſe. The Duſt in <hi>London</hi> in Summer is oftentimes, if
a Wind blow, very troubleſome, if not intolerable; in <hi>Paris</hi> there is
much leſs of it, and the reaſon is, the flat Stones require little Sand to
ſet them faſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our ſmall Pebles, not coming together, require a
vaſt quantity to lay them faſt in Paving.</p>

                  <hi>Statues Equeſtres.</hi>
               </note>But from the
People in the Streets, to the dead Ornaments there: There are an infinite
number of Buſto's of the Grand Monarque every where put up by the Common
People; but the Noble <hi>Statues</hi> are but few, conſidering the
Obſequious Humour and Capacity of the People to perform.</p>
            <p>That in the <hi>Place-Victoire</hi> is a-foot in Braſs all over
gilt; with <hi>Victoire;</hi> that is, a vaſt Winged Woman cloſe behind his
Back, holding forth a Laurel Crown over the Kings Head, with one Foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a
Globe. There are great exceptions taken at the Gilding by Artiſts; and,
indeed the ſhining ſeems to ſpoil the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and give I know not what
confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it had better have been all of Gold <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61013:20"/>braſſed over; which would have given its true Lights and Shaddows,
and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Eye to judge of the proportions. But that which I like not
in this, is the great Woman perpetually at the Kings Back; which is a ſort of
Embarras, and inſtead of giving Victory, ſeems to tire him with her
Company. The <hi>Roman Victorie</hi> was a little Puppit in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
Hand, which he could diſpoſe of at pleaſure; This Woman is enough to give
a Man a Surfeit.</p>
            <p>The other are <hi>Statuae Equeſtres,</hi> of 3 of the laſt Kings
of <hi>France,</hi> in Braſs a Horſeback.</p>
            <p>That on the <hi>Pont-neuf</hi> is of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth in
his Armour bare-headed, and Habited as the Mode of that time was.</p>
            <p>The other of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth in the
<hi>Place-Royal,</hi> Armed alſo after the Mode of the Age, and his Plume of
Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on his Headpiece.</p>
            <p>The 3d is of this preſent King <hi>Louis</hi> the Fourteenth, and
deſigned for the <hi>Place Vendoſme.</hi> This Coloſſus of Braſs is
yet in the very place where it was caſt; it is ſurpriſingly great, being
22 foot high, the Foot of the King 26 inches in length, and all the proportions
of him and the Horſe ſuitable. There was 100000 pound weight of Mettal
melted, <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61013:20"/>but it took not up above 80000 pounds; it was all
caſt at once, Horſe and Man. Monſ. <hi>Girardon</hi> told me, he wrought
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and with almoſt daily applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Model 8 years, and
there were two years more ſpent in the Mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Furnaces, and Caſting
of it. The King is in the Habit of a <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, without Stirrups
or Saddle, and on his Head a French large Periwig <hi>A-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode.</hi> Whence
this great Liberty of Sculpture ariſes, I am much to ſeek.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that in building preciſely to follow the ancient manner
and ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is very commendable, becauſe all thoſe Orders were
founded upon good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in Mathematicks; but the Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an
Emperor, was no more, than the weak fancy of the People. For <hi>Louis le
Grand</hi> to be thus dreſſed up at the head of his Army now a-days would
be very Comical. What need other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, when Truth may be had; as though the
preſent Age need be aſhamed of their Modes, or that the <hi>Statua
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtris</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, or <hi>Louis</hi> the
Thirteenth, were the leſs to be valued for being done in the true Dreſs of
their times. It ſeems to me to be the effect of Miſtaken Flattery, but if
regarded only as a Piece of meer Art, it is me-thinks <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61013:21"/>very
unbecoming, and has no Graceful Air with it.</p>
            <p>I remember I was at the <hi>Levee</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second, when 3 Models were brought him, to chooſe one of, in order to make
his Statue for the Court at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;</hi> he choſe the <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperours Dreſs, and cauſed it alſo to be executed in that other erected
for him in the <hi>Old Exchange</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> The like is of K.
<hi>J.</hi> in <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> at <hi>Chelſey-Colledge,</hi> our
<hi>Invalides.</hi> Now I appeal to all Mankind, whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting a
living Prince now a-days theſe naked Arms and Legs are decent, and whether
there is not a <hi>barbarity</hi> very diſpleaſing in it. The Father of
theſe two Kings, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, was the Prince of this Age of
the beſt Reliſh, and of a ſound Judgment, particularly in Painting,
Sculpture, Architecture by Sea and Land, witneſs the vaſt Sum of Money he
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon <hi>Rubens</hi> and his Diſciple <hi>Vandyke.</hi> Alſo
the great Eſteem he had for the incomparable <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> who was
the firſt <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in this Age that underſtood Building. I
heard <hi>Auzout</hi> ſay, when he had viewed the
<hi>Banquetting-Houſe</hi> at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> that it was preferable to
all the Buildings on this ſide the <hi>Alpes;</hi> and I ought to believe
him, he having ſtudied <hi>Vitruvius</hi> more than 40 years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61013:21"/>moſtly upon the place and at <hi>Rome.</hi> Alſo the
Ship the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> which was truly the Nobleſt floating Caſtle
that ever ſwam the Sea. Yet after all this, that King had a <hi>Statua
Equeſtris</hi> of himſelf erected, now at <hi>Charingcroſs,</hi> caſt
in the full Habit of his own time, and which I think may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the

               </note>Firſt, therefore, I
ſaw the <hi>Palais Mazarin,</hi> in which are many good Pictures, but the Low
Gallery is furniſht with a great Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Roman</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and is what I moſt took notice of; They were moſt
brought from <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Cardinal.</hi> Thoſe which are
<hi>Togatae</hi> and Cloathed, are as they were found; but ſuch as were made
<hi>Nudae,</hi> are miſerably diſguiſed by the fond Humour of the Duke
<hi>de Mazarin,</hi> who in a hot Fit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61013:22"/>cauſed
them to be caſtrated and mangled, and then frocked them by a ſad Hand with
I know not what Plaiſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> which makes them very
ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſomewhere tells us, that ſome of the ancient
Wiſe Men thought there was nothing naturally obſcene, but that every thing
might be called by its own Name; but our <hi>Celſus</hi> is of another mind,
and begs Pardon, being a <hi>Roman,</hi> that he writ of thoſe Matters in his
own Tongue. 'Tis certain upon our Subject, the Duke ſhould not have
furniſht his Cabinet and Gallery with Naked Pictures, but with the
<hi>Togatae</hi> only; or if it had once pleaſed him to do otherwiſe, he
ſhould not have Cloathed them; which was at beſt but a vain Oſtentation
of his Chaſtity, and betrayed his ignorance and diſlike of good things;
that is, ſpoils and hides the noble Art of the Sculpture, for which only they
are valuable.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould Nudity be ſo offenſive, ſince a very great
part of the World yet defies Cloaths, and ever did ſo; and the parts they do
moſt affect to cover, is from a certain neceſſity only.</p>
            <p>'Tis plain by theſe and many other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant Statues I ſaw at
<hi>Verſailles,</hi> moſt of which were taken out hence, that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Cloathing was the moſt ſimple <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61013:22"/>thing
imaginable, and that a <hi>Roman</hi> was as ſoon undreſſed as I can put
off my Gloves and Shoes. The Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men went dreſt much alike; As for the
faſhion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Habit, it is evident by theſe ancient
Statues, (which <hi>Oct. Ferrarius</hi> has well and reaſonably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in
explicating the ſeveral Garments of the Ancients) that the <hi>Tunica</hi> or
Shirt was without a Collar or Sleeves, and girt high up under the Breaſts;
alſo, that the <hi>Toga</hi> or <hi>Gown</hi> was a wide and long Garment
open at both ends, and let down over the Head, and ſupported by the Left Hand
thruſt under the Skirts of it, whilſt the top of it reſted upon the left
Shoulder; The Right Hand and Arm was naked, and above the Gown, ſo that the
Gown was ungirt and always looſe. Now for the purpoſe, when a
<hi>Roman</hi> made himſelf naked for the Bath, (as he daily did juſt
before eating) he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to draw up his Left Hand, and the Gown
fell down at his Feet; and at the ſame time to looſe the Girdle of the
Tunica, and to draw up both his Arms from under the Tunica, and that alſo
fell at his Feet.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Ages of the Commonwealth they wore a Toga or Gown
only, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they put on next the Skin a Tunica <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61013:23"/>or
Shirt, and never added more in the very Splendour and Luxury of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
all other Matters of Cloathing, of what nature ſoever, have been invented
ſince.</p>
            <p>I much admired, that in the great numbers of ancient Statues to be
ſeen in and about <hi>Paris,</hi> I could never meet any one but what was
Cloathed with a <hi>Toga pura,</hi> and no repreſentation of a Bullated
one.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Toga</hi> and <hi>Tunica</hi> both were made of fine white
Wooll, or Flannel: They had not a Rag of Linnen about them. This Flannel, I
ſay, was very fine, for the folds are ſmall, and it falls into them
eaſily; and ſeems to be very light, by the handling of it, to raiſe it by
the Finger and Thumb only, as is the Air of ſome of the Statues, and the
whole Garment to be ſuſpended by the left Shoulder: Upon the leaſt
ſtraining of it, the Breaſts and Nipples are viſible through it; alſo
the proportions of the Thighs.</p>
            <p>This wearing all Woollen in a hot Country, brought on the uſe and
neceſſity of frequent Bathing, otherwiſe they could never have kept
themſelves ſweet and clean; and the neceſſity of Bathing kept them to
this ſort of looſe Garment; and much Bathing brought in Oils, and Oils
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes infuſed in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61013:23"/>But in my mind a fair Linnen Shirt every day is
as great a preſervative to Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Cleaneſs of the Skin and Health,
as daily Bathing was to the <hi>Romans.</hi> 'Tis certain, had they not uſed
either ſimple Oils of Olives, ſometimes unripe and old, for the
aſtringency, and ſometimes ripe and perfumed, the warm Water muſt have
much decayed Nature, and made the Skin intolerable tender and wrinkled. The
Naked <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Blacks</hi> ſecure their Skins by Oils at this
day from all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the Weather, both from Heat and Cold.</p>
            <p>But the beſt Rule of Health and long Life is to do little to our
ſelves: People are not aware what inconveniencies they bring upon
themſelves by cuſtom, how they will plead for things long uſed, and make
that pleaſant which is very deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to their Healths; as in the Caſe
of Cloathing, Tobacco, Strong Waters, Steel Remedies, the Drinking Mineral
Waters, Bathing, Tea, Coffee, Chocolate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One little Statue I took more particular notice of, for the elegance
of the Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the humour of the Dreſs; it ſtood upon a Table; it
was the Figure of a Sybil: The Face of the old Woman was cut very deep into the
Stone, within the Quoifure, like a Hood pulled over the <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61013:24"/>Forehead, a very Emblem of an Oracle, which is hid, dark, and
ambiguous, as the Woman her ſelf, who would have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Face ſeen,
nor her Saying eaſily underſtood; that is, ſhe is as it were aſhamed of
her Cheat.</p>
            <p>What was the fancy of the Men of the firſt Ages to make <hi>Old
Women Propheteſſes,</hi> to utter Oracles, and to interpret the Will of the
Gods by the eating of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. To make them <hi>Sagae</hi> and
<hi>Veneficae</hi> is reaſonable enough; for old Age makes all People
ſpiteful, but more the weaker Sex; To Poiſon and Bewitch are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Revenges of Impotent People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were impatient of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Women in their
Religious Rites, leſt they ſhould contaminate and ſpoil all their
Devotion. The <hi>Romans</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thought Religion became Women
better than Men, for beſides the general parts they had in common with the
Men in Adoration of their Gods, they had alſo peculiar ones, where the Men
were not concerned. <hi>Tully</hi> bids his Wife ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Gods for
him; for he tells her, he thought they would be kinder to her than him. Upon
ſome ſuch Principle, probably, their Propheteſſes were in eſteem.</p>

his wonted manner. The two firſt are the moſt natural Thoughts and Dreſs
that can be; but nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ever came near his colouring for Fleſh

bien contre nous!</hi> as though the Matter pleaſed him, and he was glad to
find it to ſhew it the King. Monſieur <hi>le Noſtre</hi> ſpoke much of
the good Humour of his Maſter; he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me he was never ſeen in
Paſſion, and gave me many Inſtances of Occaſions, that would have
cauſed moſt Men to <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61013:26"/>have raged; which yet he put by with
all the Temper imaginable.</p>
            <p>In this Cabinet I ſaw many very rare old China Veſſels, and
amongſt them a ſmall <hi>Roman Glaſs <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn,</hi> very thick made, and
ponderous, of a blue Sea colour, the two Ears were Feet divided into 4 Claws,
but the very bottom of this Veſſel was ſmooth, and very little
umbilicate; and for this reaſon I cannot tell whether it might not be
<hi>caſt,</hi> and not <hi>blown.</hi>

                  <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> P.</note>The <hi>Palace of
Luxemburgh</hi> is the moſt finiſht of all the Royal Buildings; it is very
magnificent, well deſigned, were it not for the triflng Interſections or
round and deep Jointings of the Columns, which looks like a Cheeſemongers
Shop, and which is below the grandeur of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo hard a matter it is
to have a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of the ancient Simplicity, and not to add impertinent
Ornaments. And to ſay the truth, there are not many things in <hi>Paris</hi>
where this Chaſtity is ſtrictly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; amongſt thoſe, where
little is to be blamed, are the South Eaſt Front of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> the
Facade of <hi>St. Gervais,</hi> and the whole Building of <hi>Val de
Grace.</hi> And this Wantonneſs in additional Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments may perhaps be one
reaſon, why the <hi>Doric</hi> is more practiſed here at this 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61013:26"/>day, the Modillions naturally admitting greater variety,
and according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended uſe of the Building.</p>
            <p>In this Palace is that famous Gallery, where the Hiſtory of
<hi>Maria</hi> of <hi>Medicis</hi> is Painted by <hi>Rubens.</hi> Though this
was done 70 years ago, it is as freſh as at the firſt; ſo great a
Maſter he was in Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His Fleſh is admirable, and his Scarlet, for
which, if he had not a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, not now underſtood, he had leſs Avarice,
and more Honour, than moſt of our Modern Painters. 'Tis certain the
goodneſs of Colours was one of the great Cares and Studies of the late
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Painters; and that which ſeems moſt to have obliged them to it, was
the neceſſity they put themſelves upon, to Paint all their own Deſigns,
and more particularly the preſent Dreſſes. And though <hi>Rubens</hi> in
his Hiſtory is too much a Libertine in this reſpect, yet there is in this
very place, which we now deſcribe, much truth in the habit of his principal
Figures, as of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, the Queen, her Son, the 3
Daughters and the Cardinal; though indeed the Allegoric aſſiſtants in all
the Tableaux are very airy and fancifully ſet out. His Scholar <hi>St. Aut.
Vandyke</hi> did introduce this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty too much in <hi>England,</hi> where
the <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61013:27"/>Perſons would bear it; as the Female Sex were very
willing to do, who ſeem in his time to have been mighty fond of being Painted
in <hi>diſhabille.</hi> 'Twas this that cut out of buſineſs the beſt
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Painter of his time, <hi>Cornelius Johnſon,</hi> and
ſhortned his Life by Grief. It is certain with a little patience all Dreſs
becomes <hi>diſhabille;</hi> but I appeal, whether it is not better and much
more pleaſing to ſee the old Faſhion of a dead Friend, or Relation, or of
a Man of Diſtinction, Painted as he was, than a foppiſh Night-Gown, and odd
Quoifure, which never belonged to the Perſon Painted.</p>
            <p>But that which led me into this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection was, that the Modern
Painters have hereby an opportunity to be idle, and to have others to work
under them; it is ſufficient to finiſh the Face, and to ſend it out to be
Dreſt at the Block; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as were they obliged in Honour to Paint the whole
Dreſſes, this would make them accurate in Colouring, through the great
variety which would daily occur, and and that noble Art be in a far greater
eſteem.</p>
            <p>A good Artiſt might eaſily reduce it, and command the Purſes
of thoſe he Paints, to pay well for his labour and time, for it is the lot
but of very few Men to excel in this Noble Art.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:61013:27"/>In the Antichamber of the Queens Apartment there
are other Paintings of <hi>Rubens,</hi> as, in 3 diſtinct Tableaux, at the
upper end of the Room the Ceremonies of the Marriages of her 3 Daughters, to
<hi>Savoy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> Alſo in an other Hiſtorical
Tableaux, on the ſide of the ſame Room, he has Painted his own Picture, in
a very free and eaſie poſture, next the Eye, up in the very corner,
look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, as unconcerned in his own Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleaux, upon the 3 Ladies. He has
done his Wife in ſome of the Tableaux in the great Gallery; but in the
laſt, where the Queen is mounting up to Heaven, ſhe is drawn up after her;
but whether it be her full and heavy Body, or her Mind, ſhe is Painted in a
very unwilling po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, bending back: It ſeems her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band liked her
Company too well to part with her eaſily, or ſhe with him.</p>
            <p>Several of the Rooms of this Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were Wainſcoted with
Cedar, wrought in Flowers, as her Dreſſing Room and Oratory; which is rare
in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Floors were made of ſmall Wood put together in
Figures, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Knots were inlaid with Threads of Silver, which have a
marvellous effect; but the firmneſs, duration, and intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe
Floors, after ſo long laying, <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61013:28"/>I moſt admired: whereas
with us in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and elſewhere in <hi>Paris,</hi> they prove ſo
noiſy to tread on, and faulty, that they are in a few years intolerable.</p>

               <note place="margin">The <hi>Louvre.</hi>
               </note>'Tis pity the King has
ſo great an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> which if finiſht, (which he
might eaſily do in 2 or 3 years) would be the moſt Magnificent Palace,
perhaps, that ever was upon the Face of the Earth; and, indeed, without that be
done, <hi>Paris</hi> will never arrive at its full Beauty.</p>
            <p>There are two Stones in the Fronton of the South Eaſt Facade of
the <hi>Louvre,</hi> which are ſhewed to all Strangers, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the very
top of it, as Slates do, and meet in an angle. Theſe are very big,
<hi>viz.</hi> 54 foot long a-piece, 8 foot broad, and but 14 inches thick: The
raiſing ſo high theſe two vaſt and tender Stones was lookt upon as a
Maſter-piece of Art, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualling any thing of the Ancients of that Nature.
They were taken out of the Quarries of <hi>Meudon,</hi> where Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigneur
the Dauphin dwells.</p>
            <p>I ſaw in the Galleries of the <hi>Louvre</hi> ſome of the
Battles of <hi>Alexander</hi> by <hi>Le Brun;</hi> which are by the
<hi>French</hi> the moſt admired Pieces of Painting that have been (ſay
they) done by any Man on this ſide the <hi>Alpes;</hi> 
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61013:28"/>and of which they are not a little proud.</p>
            <p>Alſo a large Piece of <hi>Paulo Vereneſe,</hi> preſented by
the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> to the King.</p>
            <p>I cannot paſs by unmentioned the vaſt number of great Caſes in

50000 Crowns.</p>
            <p>But, indeed, that which moſt ſurpriſed me in the
<hi>Louvre</hi> was the <hi>Artellier</hi> or Work-houſe of Monſieur
<hi>Gerardon;</hi> he that made Cardinal <hi>Richelieu's Tomb,</hi> and the
<hi>Statua Equeſtris</hi> deſigned for the <hi>Place de Vendoſme;</hi> he
told me he had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 10 years in making the Model with aſſiduity
and daily application.</p>
            <p>He hath in the <hi>Louvre</hi> alſo two Rooms, in one are ancient
Marble Statues, and in the other are Braſs Statues and <hi>Vaſa,</hi> and a
100 other things relating to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: There is nothing in <hi>Paris</hi>
deſerves more to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>In this laſt, I ſaw a ſort of <hi>Egyptian Janus,</hi> with
<hi>Silenus</hi> on one ſide, and a <hi>Bacchus</hi> on the other; With many
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Egyptian Figures</hi> well deſigned; all of them with a

            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61013:29"/>Alſo a <hi>Lion of Aegypt</hi> very large of
Braſs; but the deſign rude, and more like an <hi>Indian Pagod.</hi> This
alſo had a large ſquare hole in the Back, near the Neck. The
<hi>Siamites</hi> that came in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſiy to <hi>Paris,</hi> were well
pleaſed to ſee this Figure, and ſaid, it was not unlike one of theirs;
and that that hole ſerved to put the Incenſe in, that the Smoak might come
out of the Body and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of the Lion. I doubt not but that alſo was
the uſe of the open Crowns of the reſt of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Figures,
which I had ſeen elſewhere, as well as here; and their Heads ſerved for
<hi>Perfuming Pots</hi> for themſelves: and hence alſo might ariſe, that
other Ornament of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated Heads;</hi> as this here, of a bright Flame,
caſting Rays out of and round the Head.</p>
            <p>There was alſo a ſmall Image of a Lean Man, Caſt
<hi>bent,</hi> in a ſitting Poſture, with a roll of Parchment ſpread open
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Knees, and he looking down upon it, Reading it. This was of <hi>Solid
Braſs,</hi> the Head and all: This was found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in a <hi>Mummy.</hi>
He ſeemed to have a thin Linnen Garment on, perhaps ſuch as the
<hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſts uſed to wear.</p>
            <p>Alſo he ſhewed us the <hi>Mummy of a Woman</hi> intire: The
ſcent of the Hand was <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61013:29"/>to me not unpleaſant; but I could
not liken it to any Perfume now in uſe with us; tho' I make no queſtion,
but <hi>Naptha</hi> was the great Ingredient; which indeed is ſo unuſual a
Smell, that the <hi>Mineral Waters</hi> of <hi>Hogsden</hi> near
<hi>London,</hi> (wherein the true <hi>Naptha</hi> is Subſtantially, and of
which I have ſome Ounces by me, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered off of thoſe Waters) have
impoſed upon the ignorant in Natural Hiſtory; who would make them come from
a chance Turpentine Effuſion, or the Miſcarriage of a Chymical
Experiment.</p>
            <p>Here were alſo great variety of <hi>

            <p>The <hi>Antient Heads</hi> and Buſto's in Braſs are numerous and

               </note>I was to ſee Monfieur <hi>Boudelot,</hi> whoſe

            <p>There was alſo the Skeleton of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſolid Copper, found

            <p>In his Cabinet of Medals I could not find one of <hi>Palmyra,</hi>
for which I care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enquired; for I was willing to add what could be found
in <hi>France</hi> upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>He has alſo many <hi>Marbles from Greece;</hi> moſt of which
have been publiſh'd by <hi>Spon;</hi> ſave one, and that is the moſt
Antient and moſt Curious of all; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which he is ready to publiſh a
Diſſertation. 'Tis a Catalogue in Three Columns, of the Names of the moſt
principal Perſons of <hi>Erectheis,</hi> one of the chiefeſt Tribes of
<hi>Attica,</hi> that were killed in one and the ſame year in five ſeveral
Places, where the <hi>Athenians</hi> fought under two Generals, as in

            <p>The <hi>Mautis</hi> cloſes the Column, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:61013:31"/>The Antiquity of this Marble, beſides the
known Hiſtory and Names which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the time of thoſe Men: The Figure
of the Letters are an undoubted Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for there are no double Letters
here; no η, no ω, but all graved with e, o; alſo the Letters, L, P,
Π, R, S, are very Roman. So that it is alſo an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Romans
borrowed their Letters from the Antient Greek Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</p>
            <p>The Invention and Borrowing of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was a great Happineſs to
Mankind. The Embarras in which Writing is in <hi>China,</hi> is owing to the
Misfortune of wanting an Alphabet; ſo that the <hi>Chineſe</hi> are forc'd
to expreſs every Sentence and Thought by a different Character, which has
multiplied their Writing to 120000 Characters; of which yet they have leſs
need than we in <hi>Europe,</hi> who perform all with 24 Letters, (whereof 5
add life to the other 19, ſaith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which is an Argument of
the Age he writ in, the Knowledge of Grammar, <hi>i. e.</hi> Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and

can know but of that, which they have at home: In what therefore ſhould they
employ this multitude of Characters! 'Tis, I ſay, their Misfortune not to
have Thought of an Alphabet: Their common Language is as eaſily learnt, and
conſequently might as eaſily be writ, as any in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to Monſieur <hi>Budelot</hi>'s Stores. In this

<hi>Praxiteles</hi> well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; one of <hi>Muſos</hi> the Comoedian:
Amongſt the reſt of the Marbles there is a Baſſe-Relief, very extant,
and finely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, of a Cupid aſleep, leaning his Head upon his Left Arm;
In his Hand he holds two <hi>Poppy Heads.</hi> 'Tis probable the Poppies were
Emblimatique from the Power they have in Love-Affairs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, moſt
Poiſons affect thoſe Parts chiefly, being the great Sluce of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of
the Body, or Circle of the Blood; and no People uſe Poppy more, and ſtand
more in need of it, than the Men who delight in Polygamy, the
<hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> or underſtand it better; as <hi>Olearius</hi>
teſtifies.</p>
            <p>He had an Antick <hi>Buſto</hi> of <hi>Zenobia</hi> in Marble,
with a thick Radiated Crown; of which he very obligingly gave me a 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61013:32"/>Copy, well deſigned from the Original: This was brought
out of <hi>Aſia</hi> by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Thevenot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſhewed me a <hi>Diſſertation</hi> he had written out fair
for the Preſs, about a certain Antient <hi>Intaglia</hi> of <hi>Madames,</hi>
of <hi>Ptolomaeus Auletes,</hi> or the Player upon the Flute: In this the thin
<hi>Mufler</hi> is the moſt remarkable Thing, which covers the Mouth and
Noſe. This Head is Ingraved upon an Amithyſt.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed this Gentleman's Company very often; and had much
Diſcourſe with him about his Books of the <hi>

and in one Converſation took the freedom to Diſſent from him about the

            </p>
            <p>I had rather read it thus, <hi>Io! Sat. Victoriae Io!</hi> upon the
occaſion of his returning with the Souldiers, filling their Head-Pieces with
the Shells they had gathered off of the Sea-ſhore; and the little uſe of
his new invented Letter the <hi>Digamma,</hi> which he inſtituted or borrowed

            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61013:32"/>The Shells were a Triumph much like this ſmall

<hi>Victory enough,</hi> (for ſo ſtupid a Prince as <hi>Claudius</hi>)
Let's return with the Spoils of the Ocean, and Adorn his new invented Letter
with a Palm-Branch; the Reverſe of this Coin being a Lawrel-Crown: Both the
Signs of Victory.</p>
            <p>About the <hi>Bouſtrophedon</hi> way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, mentioned by

            <p>He ſhewed me alſo a <hi>Stone</hi> taken late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Body

they Diſſected him, that is, certain Ignorant People; in the lower part of
the Body, (probable the Bladder) was found this Stone: It weighs, as I gueſs,
two Pound; it is as round as a Cannon Ball; it is laminated like an Onion; for
the firſt <hi>Couche</hi> was broken up in ſome Places, of a dark Hair
colour, and tranſparent; or like ſome Cloudy Agats which I have ſeen: It
was very ponderous. Such like Tranſparent Stones I had a Patient voided often

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61013:33"/>foot diameter, which at that time of the year,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> did fire Wood into a

            <p>I was indiſpoſed, and ſo could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Favour which
was offered me of ſeeing the Moon in their Teleſcopes; and to go down into
the Vault, which was contrived for ſeeing the Stars at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, but without
ſucceſs. I was told by Monſieur <hi>Roman</hi> afterwards, that there was
a Rock formed in the Cave by the dropping of a Spring of Petrifying Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; of
which Nature are all the Wells in <hi>Paris.</hi>

            <p>In the <hi>Flore</hi> of one of the Octogone Towers they have

            <p>His Nephew Monſieur <hi>Moraldi</hi> was with him; as for his

Arch.</hi>
               </note>The <hi>Triumphal Arch</hi> out of the Gate of <hi>St.
Antoine</hi> is well worth ſeeing; for in this the <hi>French</hi> pretend
not only to have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the Ancients, but to have out-done them. They have
indeed, uſed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Blocks of Stone that could be got, and have laid
them without Mortar, and the leaſt ſide outward, after the manner of the
Ancients; but I am afraid their Materials are very ſhort of the
<hi>Roman,</hi> and their Stone is ill choſe, though vaſtly great.</p>
            <p>Indeed the <hi>Deſign</hi> is moſt Magnificent; it is finiſht
in <hi>Plaiſter,</hi> that is, the <hi>Model</hi> of it, in its full Beauty
and Proportions.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it was intended for a Gate or Entrance into the City;
for it fronts the great Street of the Suburbs, and has a vaſt Walk planted
with Trees leading from it towards <hi>Bois de Vincennes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more built but the four Parts of the Foundation of
the true Building, raiſed only to the foot of the Pedeſtals; The Foundation
is laid 22 foot deep.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the vaſt Blocks of Stone, which take up a great
compaſs before the Building, I found ſeveral ſorts, all brought from the
Quarries not far from <hi>Paris;</hi> all of them are of a kind of courſe
Grit, which will not burn into <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61013:34"/>Lime. They diſtinguiſh
theſe Stones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 4 ſorts; 1. <hi>Pierre d'arcueil,</hi> for the firſt 2
or 3 couches or lays above the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; This is <hi>St. Clou,</hi> which is
good, and the next beſt. I did not find by the Blocks deſigned either for
the Walls of the Building; or the Rounds of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; that the Beds of
Stone of <hi>St. Clou</hi> are above two foot thick. 3. That of <hi>S.
Lieu;</hi> this is but indifferent, but yet much better then that Stone which
is taken up out of the Stone Pits, in and about <hi>Paris,</hi> which makes the
4th ſort of Stone: If it be wrought up into Walls, as it is taken out of the
Pits, it is very apt to be flawed by the Froſt; but if it be laid in the Air,
and kept under cover for two years, then it becomes dry and more durable.</p>
            <p>I ſaw but one Piece in <hi>Paris</hi> of the Ruines of an <hi>Old
Roman Building;</hi> it was in <hi>La Rue de la Harpe.</hi> The Vaults are very
high and large. The manner of Building is near the ſame I formerly cauſed
exactly to be figured and deſcribed at <hi>York,</hi> and which is publiſht
in the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic Tranſactions;</hi> That is, the inſide and

and then 4 rows of flat, thin and broad <hi>Roman <pb n="56" facs="tcp:61013:35"/>Bricks,</hi> and ſo alternatively from the top to the bottom; Which
makes it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was built after <hi>Severus</hi>'s time, for this was the
<hi>African</hi> manner of Building, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> tells us; and
therefore might well be, what Tradition here ſays of it, <hi>viz.</hi> part

               </note>Amongſt the many Cabinets
of <hi>Paris</hi> there is nothing finer than the Collection of Monſieur
<hi>Buco, Gad-eroles du Parlement.</hi> You paſs through a long
Gallery, the one ſide of which is a well furniſhed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and alſo
well diſpoſed in Wired Caſes. This Gallery leads into two Rooms very
finely adorned with Pictures, Vaſa's, Statues and Figures in Braſs, China,
and the famous Ennamel Veſſels, formerly made in <hi>Poitu,</hi> which are
not now to be had; and a thouſand other curious things.</p>
            <p>I very particularly examined his large quantity of <hi>Shells,</hi>
conſiſting in near 60 Drawers. There were indeed very many of a ſort, and
not many but what I had ſeen before, and figured; He very oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly lent me
thoſe I had not ſeen, to have the deſigns of them done. He had many very
perfect and large ones of Land and Freſh Water <hi>Buccina;</hi> but yet a
great number were wanting of thoſe very Tribes of what I have publiſht.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61013:36"/>Here were alſo 2 or 3 very fair ones of that
ſort of compreſt Snail, which have their Tail on the ſame ſide with
their Mouth; and the Vulgar Name, by which thoſe <hi>Men of Cabinets</hi>
diſtinguiſh them, is not amiſs, <hi>viz. Des Lampes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſhewed me a Bivalve, which is not uncommon (in a large
<hi>Blood red Spondile</hi>) for which the late Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> gave
900 Livres, which is above 50<hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> Sterling;</hi> and he alſo
aſſured me, that the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offered a <hi>Pariſian</hi> for 32
Shells 11000 Livres; which Sum was refuſed; but the Duke replied, That he
knew not who was the greater Fool, he that bid the Price, or the Man that
refuſed it.</p>
            <p>I alſo ſaw in this Collection an <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campus</hi> about 4
inches long, the Tail ſquare, thick Bellied and Breaſt like a <hi>Miller
Thumb,</hi> Winged not unlike a ſort of Flying Fiſh, but the Fins were
ſpoiled, the Membranes being torn from the Bones of the Wings, the Head long
and ſquare like the Tail, with a ſort of tufted Muſle. This Fiſh I took
to be of the <hi>Hippocampus</hi> Kind; and (as he told me) it was given him by
my Lady <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> poſſibly out of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s
Collection, who had many curious Preſents made him (as one of Shells from the

            <p>Here alſo was a <hi>Veſpetum Canadenſe</hi> of a moſt
elegant Figure, and admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance; of which I have a Drawing. This is
intire in all its parts; it is as big as a middle-ſized Melon,
Pear-faſhion, with an edge running round where it is thickeſt, from which
edge it ſuddenly declines and leſſens into a point; at the very end of
the point, on one ſide, is a little hole, with pulvinated or ſmooth edges
inclined inward; otherwiſe it is whole, and wrought upon the Twig of a Tree,
of a very ſmooth Sattin-like Skin. <hi>Table</hi> 1. <hi>Figure</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Striated Skin of an <hi>African</hi> Aſs, ſupple and
well cured, which I had never ſeen before. It is certainly a moſt beautiful
Animal; and, I admire, after ſo many Ages that it has been known to the
People of <hi>Europe,</hi> it could never be Tamed, and made of common uſe,
as the reſt of the Horſe Kind. This was only of two colours, <hi>viz.</hi>
broad liſts of White and Bay or Cheſnut colour drawn from the Back down the
Sides to the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which was all White: The liſts were parted at the Back
by a very narrow ridge of ſhort Hair; which Liſts alſo went round the
Legs like Garters. The Hair <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61013:37"/>coloured Stripes of the
<hi>African</hi> Aſs were, near the Back, 3 or 4 Fingers broad, alſo the
Liſt down the Back was very broad.</p>
            <p>Another Skin of a Cap-Aſs I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaw at Dr.
<hi>Turnfords;</hi> and the Stripes were the ſame, but much broader and
darker coloured; it may be from the different Ages. This ſort of Striping
ſeems to be peculiar to the Aſs, for the moſt common to be ſeen with us

Purſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of his vaſt Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Seeds and

            <p>He alſo ſhewed me 10 or 12 ſingle Sheets of Vellom, on each of
which were Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Water Colours very lively, one ſingle Plant, moſtly
in flower, by the beſt Artiſt in <hi>Paris,</hi> at the King's Charge;
Thoſe are ſent to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> when the Doctor has put the Names

or lower end is a little pointed, and riſing in the middle; The outward Skin
is as ſmooth as Velom, and of a whitiſh grey, next to the Pearl colour. The
Button at the bigger end in this being broken, and the outward Skin pilled off,
I could ſee a hole of about half an inch diameter in the very middle, into
which the Waſps go in and out; The Cells are ſexangular, but of a very

Quill; and conſequently appear very thick ſet and numerous. <hi>See the

Diſſecting Room, working by himſelf upon a Dead Body, with his Breaſt

Companion, it being morning, and his Senſes very quick and vigorous, was
ſtrangely ſurpriſed and offended; and retired down the Stairs much
faſter than he came up: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a private Anatomy Room is to one not
accuſtomed to this kind of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, very irkſome, if not frightful:
Here a Basket of Diſſecting Inſtruments, as Knives, Saws,

after the ſame manner: Here a Trey full of Bits of Fleſh, for the more
minute Diſcovery of the Veins and Nerves; and every where ſuch

               <note place="margin">Monſieur <hi>Merrie.</hi>
               </note>I ſaw
Monſieur <hi>Merrie,</hi> a moſt painful and accurate Anatomiſt, and free
and communicative Perſon, at his Houſe <hi>Rue de la Princeſſe.</hi>
His Cabinet conſiſted of two Chambers: In the outward were great variety of
Skeletons; alſo entire Preparations of the Nerves; in two of which he
ſhewed me the miſtake of <hi>Willis,</hi> and from thence gathered, that he
was not much uſed to Diſſect with his own Hand: The <hi>Pia Mater</hi>
coating the Spinal Nerves but half way down the Back, where it ends: The
<hi>Dura Mater</hi> coating the lowermoſt 20 pair; which, <hi>Willis,</hi>
(as he ſaid) has otherwiſe reported.</p>
            <p>But that which much delighted my Curioſity, was the
Demonſtration of a blown and dried Heart of a <hi>Foetus;</hi> alſo the
Heart of a <hi>Tortoiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61013:39"/>In the Heart of a <hi>Foetus,</hi> he ſhewed
it quite open, and he would have it that there was no Valve to the <hi>Foramen
Ovale;</hi> which ſeem'd equally open from the Left Ventricle to the Right,
as the contrary; that it's Diameter well near equalled that of the
<hi>Aorta:</hi> That the two Arteries, which aſcend up into the two Lobes of
the Lungs, (and are the Ramifications of the Pulmonick Artery, after it has
parted with the <hi>Canal of Communication,</hi> which goes betwixt the
Pulmonick Artery and the lower or deſcending Branch of the <hi>Aorta</hi>)
both put together, far exceed, if not double the Diameter of the <hi>Aorta</hi>
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>He therefore, not without good Reaſon aſſirms, That of all the
Blood which the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> pours into the Right Ventricle of the Heart,
and is thence in a <hi>Foetus</hi> forced up into the Pulmonick Artery, a great
part is carried by the Canal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication into the deſcending Trunk of
the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and is ſo circulated about the Body, the Lungs (as to
that part) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly ſlighted: Alſo that of the two remaining thirds of
the Blood, which is carried about the Lungs, when it comes down the Pulmonick
Vein, that which cannot be received by the <hi>Aorta,</hi> (and all cannot,
becauſe the <hi>Aorta</hi> is much leſs <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61013:40"/>than the two
Branches of the Pulmonick Artery put together) is therefore <hi>diſcharged
back</hi> through the <hi>Foramen Ovale,</hi> into the Right Ventricle of the
Heart, and ſo thrown up again with the reſt of the Blood, coming from the
<hi>Vena Cava.</hi> So that one part of the two remaining parts of the Blood is
daily carried about the Body, as in an Adult Foetus, and a third part only
Circulates in the Lungs, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the Body or Grand Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>That all this is done to abbreviate and reduce the Circulation to a
leſſer compaſs, is certain; and ſo for the ſame Reaſon and End,
that other leſſer Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Liver is ſlighted by the Blood,
which returns from the Placenta, by a Canal of Communication betwixt the
<hi>Porta</hi> and the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon he gives of this, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all allow of; as being
very ill grounded; and therefore I ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf to Confute,
or ſo much as Name it.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Heart of the Land Tortoiſe,</hi> it was preſerved
in Spirit of Wine, and all the three Ventricles thereof ſlit and opened; ſo
that I had not all the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I could have wiſht: but the Left 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61013:40"/>Ventricle in this Animal had no Artery belonging to it, but
did receive only the Blood, which deſcended from the Lungs, and convey it by
the <hi>Foramen Ovale</hi> into the Right Ventricle: That the third or middle
Ventricle was only an Appendix to the Right, and had the Pulmonick Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
iſſuing from it. So that the Blood in a <hi>Tortois</hi> was in a manner
Circulated like that in a <hi>Foetus,</hi> through the Body, the Lungs as it
were or in good part ſlighted.</p>
            <p>This Thought of Monſieur <hi>Merrie</hi>'s has made a great Breach
betwixt Monſieur <hi>Verney</hi> and himſelf; for which Reaſon I had not
that freedom of Converſation as I could have wiſht with both of them; but
'tis to be hoped there may come good from an honeſt Emulation.</p>
            <p>Two Engliſh Gentlemen came to Viſit me, Mr. <hi>Bennis</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Probie:</hi> They were lodged near the Royal Garden, where Monſieur
<hi>Verney</hi> dwells, and makes his Anatomies, who in Three Months time
ſhewed all the Parts of the Body to them. He had for this purpoſe at
leaſt Twenty Human Bodies, from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the Chatelet, (where thoſe
are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd who are found Murthered in the Streets, which is a very common
buſineſs at <hi>Paris</hi>) and from the Hoſpitals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:61013:41"/> They told me, Monſieur <hi>Verney</hi>
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhew them a Valve, which did hinder Blood from falling back
into the Right Ventricle by the <hi>Foramen Ovale.</hi> This Valve they ſaid
he compared to the Papillae in the Kidneys, Muſculous and Fleſhy: That if
Wind was blown into the <hi>Vena Pulmonalis,</hi> it did not paſs through the
<hi>Foramen Ovale,</hi> but ſtop there, by reaſon of the Valve. That he did
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, contrary to Mr. <hi>Merrie,</hi> that no Blood did circulate through
the Lungs in an Embrio.</p>
            <p>Again, in another Converſation with Monſieur <hi>Merrie,</hi> he
ſhewed me the blown Hearts of an Embrio, and that of a Girl of 7 years old. I
ſaw clearly, that the Skin of the ſuppoſed Valve of the <hi>Fora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Ovale,</hi> was as it were ſuſpended with two Ligaments: And that in the
Girl's, the two ſides of the <hi>Foramen Ovale</hi> were drawn one over the
other, and ſo cloſed the hole; but were eaſily to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated again
by a Briſtle thruſt betwixt them.</p>
            <p>Alſo it ſeemed to me, that this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane in an Embrio might
cover the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramen Ovale,</hi> like the <hi>Membrana Nictans</hi> in a
Brids Eye, that is, be drawn over it, and ſo hinder the Ingreſs of the
Blood from the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> as oft as the Right Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricle 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61013:41"/>beats: But the Dilating it ſelf might give way to the
deſcending Blood of the <hi>Vena Pulmonalis;</hi> and poſſibly, the
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio living as it were the Life of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect, can by this Artifice
Command the Heart.</p>
            <p>I remember in Diſcourſe that day with him, he told me, That
Monſieur <hi>Verney</hi> had an old <hi>Cat,</hi> and a young
<hi>Kitling</hi> juſt Born, put into the Air-Pump before the <hi>Academie
Royalle des Sciences:</hi> That the Cat died after 16 Pumps, but the Kitling
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived 500 Pumps; which favours in ſome meaſure the Command young
Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals have of their Hearts.</p>
            <p>At another Viſit, Monſieur <hi>Merrie</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly procured
for me, the Heart of a Human Embrio, with the Lungs intire. He tried before me
the Experiment upon Blowing, and alſo Syringing Water into the
<hi>Aorta,</hi> both which filled the Auricles and Ventricles, and freely came
out at the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> only. Then he opened the Right Auricle and
Ventricle, where the <hi>Foramen Ovale</hi> was open only at one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not
the tenth part of its breadth; and a Membrane drawn over the reſt, which
Membrane was faſtned to the ſides quite round. Then he opened in the ſame
manner the Left Ventricle and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricle, and there it was evident, that that 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61013:42"/>Membrane which cloſed the hole, had two narrow Straps or
Muſcles by which it was faſtned to the oppoſite ſides, after the manner
of ſome of the Valves of the Heart.</p>
            <p>I told him, that it muſt follow from this, that the <hi>Foramen
Ovale</hi> was ſhut and opened more or leſs, at the pleaſure of the
Embrio, according to the Neceſſities of Nature, and the quantity of Blood
that was to paſs: That it was probable, that all Inſects had a Command of
their Hearts, (of which I had given large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances elſewhere) by ſome
ſuch paſſage, which they could ſhut altogether, or in great part, as
they had a Mind, in Winter, in Fear, or Faſting for want of Food: That the
ſhutting up of the paſſage in Adult Animals was therefore done in an
inſtant, by drawing the Curtain fully, which could never be again drawn back
and opened, becauſe of the great torrent of Blood, which now entred the Right
Auricle, ſtopt it in that poſture, which in time would altogether ſtiffen
and loſe its Motion of Relaxation. As a Hen, when ſhe Sleeps, draws over
the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana Nictans;</hi> and likewiſe when ſhe Dies, the ſame
Membrane covers all the Eye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:61013:42"/>Mr. <hi>Bennis</hi> procured me the Heart of a
Humane <hi>Foetus,</hi> which had but juſt breath'd; the which I examined
with Monſieur <hi>Litre</hi> of <hi>Caſtres</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi>
another very Underſtanding and Dextrous Anatomiſt, and who Teaches Scholars
of all Nations the Practice of Anatomy. The Experiments here were repeated as
formerly deſcribed; Both Wind and Water paſſed the <hi>Foramen
Ovale,</hi> both from the <hi>Vena Pulmonum,</hi> and from the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
That which I obſerved in this Heart more particularly, was, That the Membrane
or Valve on the Left ſide of the <hi>Foramen Ovale</hi> was flat, and
extended almoſt over the hole, without any <hi>Limbus</hi> round its edges,
becauſe it was nothing but the very ſubſtance of the <hi>Auricula
Siniſtra</hi> continued, or a Proceſs thereof: But on the right ſide the
<hi>Vena Cava</hi> being joined to the Auricle, it had a riſing edge round
that part of it, whence it proceeded; that is, that the two Faces had contrery
openings, and being drawn as it were one over the other, they ſhut the hole;
but not ſo firmly, but the hole might be more or leſs open all a Man's
Life. For thoſe two Oval Proceſſes ſticking cloſe together in a blown
and dried Heart, that is not to be much heeded, for I have ſeen them dry with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61013:43"/>the hole open; but it has been like as betwixt unglued
Paper, or as the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deſcend betwixt the Skins of the Bladder, or as
the ſame happens to the <hi>Ductus Bilaris</hi> in its inſertion into the
Guts.</p>
            <p>The ſame Perſon brought me the Heart of a Man 40 years old, in
which the <hi>Foramen Ovale</hi> was as much open, as in a <hi>Foetus</hi> new
born; and the Ligaments very conſpicuous, which tack the ſides of the Valve
to the Auricle, and go over to the other ſide of the Border.</p>

in Folio</hi> of Deſigns and Paintings of <hi>Plants, Birds, Fiſhes,</hi>
and <hi>Infects</hi> of the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> all done by himſelf very
accurately. He is a very underſtanding Man in ſeveral parts of Natural
Hiſtory, but eſpecially in <hi>Bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique.</hi> he had been formerly in
<hi>America,</hi> at his return Printed, at the King's Charge, a Book of
<hi>American</hi> Plants in Folio. This Book was ſo well approved of, that he
was ſent again thither at the King's Charge, and returned after ſeveral
years <pb n="73" facs="tcp:61013:43"/>wandring about the Iſlands with this Cargo. He was
more than once Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt, and loſt his <hi>Specimens</hi> of all things,
but preſerved his Papers, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fortunately lodged them in other
Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; ſo that the things themſelves I did not ſee. He had
deſigned and Diſſected a Crocodile; one of the Sea Tortoiſes; a Viper,
and well deſcribed the Diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>His Birds alſo were well underſtood, and very well painted in
their proper colours. I took notice of 3 ſorts of Owles, one with Horns, all
diſtinct Species from our <hi>European.</hi> Several of the Hawk Kind and
Falcons of very beautiful Plumage; and one of thoſe, which was Coal black as
a Raven. Alſo (which I longed to ſee) there was one Species of the Swallow
Kind, very diſtinct from the 4 Species we have in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt the Fiſh there were two new Species of <hi>American</hi>
Trouts, well known by the Fleſhy Fin near the Tail.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the Inſects there was a <hi>Scolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendra</hi> of a foot
and an half long, and proportionably broad. Alſo the <hi>Julus</hi> very
elegantly painted, which I had ſeen before in Dr. <hi>Turnfort</hi>'s
Collection. <hi>Table</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Alſo a very large Wood-Frog, with the extremity of the Toes
webbed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:61013:44"/>Alſo a Blood-red <hi>Polypus,</hi> with very
long Legs, two of which I could diſcern by the Draught were thick
<hi>acetabulated.</hi> This, he told me, was ſo venemous, that upon the
leaſt touch it would cauſe an inſupportable burning pain, which would
laſt ſeveral hours.</p>
            <p>There were alſo ſome few Species of the Serpent and Lizard
Kind.</p>
            <p>There were but few <hi>Shells;</hi> but amongſt them there was a
<hi>Murex</hi> (See <hi>T.</hi> 4.) which dies purple, with the Fiſh as it
exerts it ſelf in the Sea. Alſo that Land <hi>Buccinum</hi> (ſee
<hi>Tab.</hi> 3.) which I have figured, and which lays Eggs with hard Shells,
and for bigneſs, and ſhape, and colour, ſcarce to be diſtinguiſht
from the Sparrow Eggs. And becauſe the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rex</hi> and this
<hi>Buccinum</hi> was drawn with the Animals creeping out, I deſired a Copy
of them, which he freely and in a moſt obliging manner granted me; He
deſigned the <hi>Buccinum Terreſtre</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>St.
Domingo,</hi> where he found it.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the vaſt Collection of Plants, I obſerved the Torch
Kind, and Fernes were of all others the moſt numerous; of each of which there
were an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Species. There were 2 or 3 Species of Goosberries
and Currants; and ſome Species of Wild Grapes; all <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61013:44"/>which
<hi>F. Plumier</hi> told me were good to eat.</p>
            <p>He told me theſe Drawings would make 10 Books, as big as that he
had publiſht; and Two Books of Animals: He had been often at
<hi>Verſailles</hi> to get them into the Kings <hi>Imprimerie;</hi> but as

which he avowed was all he thought.</p>
            <p>He told me he had two more Volumes ready for the Preſs, and did

<hi>Hippocrates.</hi> In which Volumes will be theſe Treatiſes: <hi>Of
Dreams: Of the Regimen in Acute Diſeaſes: The Prognoſticks: The

            </p>
            <p>On that <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> he ſeemed to me to have a very happy

uſed to anſwer ſo great variety of Subjects, and ſuch a quantity of
Letters as he muſt receive weekly; for I knew he never failed, becauſe I
had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Correſpondence for 10 or 12 years. He told me he made
one Letter anſwer another, and that to be always freſh, he never read a
Letter before he <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61013:46"/>had Pen, Ink and Paper ready to anſwer

            </p>
            <p>He more than once ſhewed me (which is his great Diverſion) a
mighty Collection of Loadſtones, to the value of ſeveral Hundred Pounds
<hi>Sterling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some he had as hard almoſt as Steel, and others ſoft and
friable; yet of theſe he had thoſe which were of as great virtue, as any of
the hard; That of the equally hard there were very great difference.</p>
            <p>He had one which weighed naked not above a Drachm, and would naked
take up a Drachm and an half; but ſhod would take up 144 Drachms of Iron, if
rightly applied, that is, if the Iron to be taken up did firmly and in a plain
touch alike both the Feet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:61013:47"/>The beſt Shod were theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Slate Loadſtone,</hi> which I noted not ſo much for its
ſtrength, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its peculiar make, being fairly and diſtinctly
luminous throughout, weighing One ounce and an half, draws up One pound.</p>
            <p>2. A Smooth Loadſtone, weighing One drachm, two ſcruples,
fourteen grains, draws up Eighteen ounces, that is Eighty two times its
weight.</p>
            <p>3. Another Smooth Loadſtone, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sixty five grains, draws up
Fourteen ounces, that is, One hundred and forty four times its weight.</p>
            <p>There is, a Loadſtone no bigger then a Hazel Nut, which took up a
huge Bunch of Keys.</p>
            <p>We have a very large Slate Loadſtone in the Repoſitory at
<hi>Greſham-Colledge,</hi> at leaſt 6 inches over; This alſo is but weak;
Whether the <hi>Laminae</hi> do ſpoil the vertue, as though they were but
ſo many diſtinct Stones packt together. And yet a Loadſtone which takes
up <hi>ex. gr.</hi> 6 pound weight, cut by the Axis in two halves, and both
halves ſhod again, will take up 8 pound.</p>
            <p>It is plain, that Experiments are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made with a
<hi>Terrella,</hi> or ſpherical Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, than a ſquare one; and his
way <pb n="82" facs="tcp:61013:48"/>of capping the <hi>Terrella</hi> is very well
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived.</p>
            <p>A ſquare Loadſtone made into a <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella,</hi> will near
take up as much weight as it did before, though a great deal of the Stone is
loſt in the rounding, by virtue of the different ſhooing.</p>
            <p>He entertained us full two hours with Experiments neatly contrived
about the effects of the Loadſtone.</p>
            <p>The Experiment of approaching a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to the Spring of a
Watch is very fine; it cauſes the Ballance to move very ſwift, and brought
yet nearer, to ſtop quite and ceaſe moving.</p>
            <p>Another Experiment was an inch broad Plate of Iron, turned into a
Ring of about 4 inches diameter, which had evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently two North and two South
Poles, which he ſaid he had ſeen in a Loadſtone, and had contrived this
in imitation of Nature. The working of them with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Steel, drigged
upon a Plate, ſet upon the Ring, did clearly manifeſt the double
Polarity.</p>
            <p>Alſo the ſuſpending of a Needle in the Air, and a Ball of
Steel upon the point of it, by a Thred, which a weight kept down, that it could
not aſcend higher, than ſuch a diſtance within the ſphere of the
activity of the Loadſtone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:61013:48"/>Again, the free working of the Needle in Water,
through Braſs, Gold, Stone, Wood, or any thing but Iron. He told us, he had a
Stone, which would work through a Stone Wall of 18 inches.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he demonſtrated by many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, how the
<hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone work in a Circle, that is, what flows
from the North Pole, comes round, and enters the South Pole; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
what flows from the South Pole, enters the North, and in its way puts in order
all ſuch Filings of Steel it meets with; that is, according to the
diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its own whirling, and the circular lines it keeps in its
flying about the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. Indeed, it is pleaſant to ſee, how the Steel
Filings are diſpoſed; and in their arangement one clearly ſees a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
image of the road, which the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inviſible Matter takes in coming
forth, and re-entring the Poles of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
            <p>He ſhewed us a Loadſtone ſawed off that piece of the Iron Bar,
which held the Stones together at the very top of the Steeple of
<hi>Chartres;</hi> This was a thick Cruſt of Ruſt, part of which was turned
into a ſtrong Loadſtone, and had all the properties of a Stone dug out of
the Mine. <hi>Manſ. de la Hire</hi> has Printed a <pb n="84" facs="tcp:61013:49"/>Memoire
of it; alſo Monſ. <hi>de Vallemont</hi> a Treatiſe. The very outward
Ruſt had no Magnetic Virtue, but the inward had a ſtrong one, as to take up
a third part more than its weight unſhod. This Iron had the very grain of a
ſolid Magnet, and the brittleneſs of a Stone.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen, who have writ of this, have, in my Opinion,
miſs'd their purpoſe, when they enquire, how it comes to paſs to be thus
turned; for it is certain, all Iron will in time go back into its Mineral
Nature again, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Artifice of Melting and Hammering. I have
ſeen of thoſe Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cannon, which had lain many
years buried in the Ground, under the old Fort at <hi>Hull</hi> in
<hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> which were thoroughly turned into brittle Iron Stone, or
Mine again; and would not own the Loadſtone, no more than the reſt of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Iron Mine, till it was calcined, and then ſhewed it ſelf
to be good Iron again. Alſo I have ſeen, and had by me, a piece of Wood
taken out of <hi>Lough-Neagh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was not only good
Iron Mine, but a Loadſtone too; ſo that it is evident, Nature, in this
ſort of Mine, goes backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is generated and regenerated; and
therefore Monſ. <hi>de la Hire</hi> has well <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61013:49"/>uſed the

and has accounted for theſe and many more Experiments of this Nature, which
he had ſhewn him by Mr. <hi>Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> whom he mentions very
Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
            <p>And yet after all, the nature of theſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> are
little known, and what is ſaid by <hi>Des Cartes</hi> of Screw faſhioned
Particles, and the inviſible Channels and Pores and Pipes of the Loadſtone,
are all meer Fancies without any Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Nature. It is well called by
ſome a certain Magnetick Matter, but <pb n="86" facs="tcp:61013:50"/>what properties it
hath, is little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
            <p>It is very ſtrange to me, that a little Loadſtone, of that
prodigious force, ſhould have ſo ſhort a ſphere of activity, and not
ſenſibly to affect Iron above an inch or two; and the biggeſt and
ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not above a foot or two. We ſee the Vortices in Water, how
wide they work round about them, vaſtly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Circles; and what
little reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the Air can make to a body of that ſubtilty, as the
<hi>Effluvia</hi> of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which can with eaſe penetrate all
Bodies whatſoever, Marble, Flints, Glaſs, Copper, Gold, without any
ſenſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of its virtue. Again, we ſee the Flame of a Lamp in
Oil, or Tallow, or Wax, how ſhort it is; and how long and tapering it is in
Spirit of Wine. If therefore the Magnetick Matter was darted out of infinite
ſmall Pipes, and was of the nature of a more ſubtile and inviſible Flame,
why does it not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue its courſe in a direct line to a great length, but
return ſo ſuddenly? We ſee the perſpiration of our Skins to riſe into
the Air, and continue to mount which yet has but a weak impulſe from the
Heart, being interrupted and broke off, when it comes out of the Road of the 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61013:50"/>Blood into the <hi>Ductus Excretorii.</hi> But the Circle
of the Magnetick Matter is without any impulſe, that we know of, from the
Stone; and moves in a double circle, and with a double and contrary ſtream in
the ſame Pipes, contrary to the Laws of the Circulation of the Blood in
Animals; which has naturally but one Currant, and one Road round; for the whole
Maſs of Veſſels, in which the Circulation of the Blood is concerned, is
but one continued Pipe.</p>
            <p>Until the Nature of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known, no very
ſatisfactory Account can be given of the moſt common Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of the
Loadſtone, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> why it does not draw to it all Bodies alike? why
a great Loadſtone, though weak, extends its vertue much farther, than a
ſmall one, though ſtrong? Why a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone communicates its vertue to
Iron, as ſoon as it touches it, nay even at ſome diſtance, and gives it
the properties of a Loadſtone.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, the Earth's being a great Magnet ſeems to me a meer
Viſion and Fable; for this reaſon, becauſe it is not Iron. 'Tis true,
Iron Mine is the moſt common of all Minerals, and found al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all
places; but it holds not any proportion with the reſt of the Foſſils of 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61013:51"/>the Earth; and is not, at a gueſs, as a million to other
Foſſils; This ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any one, who has well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
Chalky Mountains and Cliffs, the high Rag-ſtone Mountains and Lime Stone
Cliffs, the ſeveral Quarries and Pits ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bowels of the Earth
for Coal, and Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how little Iron there is to be found in
compariſon of other Matters. Add to this, that very little of that very Iron
Mine, which is to be found any where, is Magnetick, or capable of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to
the Magnet, till it is calcined: Whence therefore ſhould all thoſe
Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Effluvia</hi> ariſe, which are ſuppoſed every where
plentifully to incompaſs the Earth? And why ſhould they be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to
be every where wandring in the Air, ſince 'tis evident, they make haſte to
return to the Stone that emitted them, and are as afraid to leave it, as the
Child the Mother before it can go?</p>
            <p>Towards the diſcovery of the Nature of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of
the Loadſtone, ſuch Particulars as thoſe, in my Opinion, ought chiefly to
be conſidered, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with all induſtry. The Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is
very good, if not the beſt Iron Mine. The ſole Fuſion of the Loadſtone
turns it into Iron; The Fire deſtroys its very virtue, and ſo does
Vitrification <pb n="89" facs="tcp:61013:51"/>Iron. Fire will make Iron Mine own the
Loadſtone, and turn to a Magnet; Ruſt, (into which all Iron will naturally
turn) and the reduction of Iron again to its Mine, will take away all the
Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick capacity of Iron. A Loadſtone cannot be made to alter its Poles,
but Iron may; nor be deſtroyed, but by the Fire. A great and long Bar of Iron
is naturally a Loadſtone, if held up perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly, and it changes its
Poles at the pleaſure of him that holds it: A ſtrong Loadſtone loſes
much of its virtue by touching Iron, but after a few days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it again: A
ſmall and weak Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone cannot touch to give its virtue to a great lump
of Iron: A Loadſtone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Air is ſpoilt in time: The deeper
the Vein of Iron Mine is, where Loadſtone is found, the better the Stone, and
how far, this holds true; for I do not doubt, but a very hard Stone may be
found near the day, as well as deeper: A Ruler or long Plate of Steel is much
better touched with the virtue of the Loadſtone, than a Plate of meer Iron of
the ſame figure; but on the contrary a Plate of Iron ſticks much faſter
to the Loadſtone, than a Plate of Steel; ſo as if a Loadſtone draws up a
Plate of Steel of 3 Ounces, it will draw up a Plate of <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61013:52"/>Iron
of four Ounces and more. Why Iron faſtned to the Poles of a Magnet does ſo
vaſtly improve its ſtrength, as to be 150 times ſtronger than when
Naked.</p>
            <p>Since therefore a Loadſtone is nothing elſe but good Iron Mine,
and may be turned into Iron; and Iron moſt eaſily, and of its ſelf into
Load-Stone, the way to find out the Nature of thoſe <hi>Magnetick
Effluvia,</hi> ſeems to be to enquire ſtrictly into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Iron
Mine, and Iron it ſelf; and not to run giddily into Hypotheſes, before we
are well ſtocked with the Natural Hiſtory of the Load-Stone, and a larger
quantity of Experiments and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons relating to Iron and its Mine, with
all the Difference and Species of them; which I think has hitherto been little
heeded. For Nature will be its own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, in this, as well as in all
other Matters of Natural Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Butterfield,</hi> in another Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, told me, He
had obſerved Load-Stones, which were ſtrong without arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and being
armed, had not that great advantage by it, as one could have expected: And that
on the contrary, there were others, which had a more incredible Virtue when
armed, than they did promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61013:52"/>That it ſeldom happens, that a Load-Stone hath
as much Virtue in one of its Poles, as in the other; and that a bit of Iron is
toucht equally well at either of the Poles of one and the ſame
Load-Stone.</p>
            <p>That there are Load-Stones which take up much, and which
notwithſtanding are incapable of well touching Iron; ſo that a Stone armed,
which takes up ſeven Pound, yet cannot Communicate to a Ruler of Iron, the
Virtue of taking up a very ſmall Needle.</p>
            <p>That a Load-Stone of 10 Ounces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to the weight of 6
Ounces or thereabouts, did almoſt the ſame effect as before,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cauſed Mr. <hi>Butterfield</hi> to make the <hi>Slate
Load-Stone</hi> into a <hi>Terella,</hi> and when ſhod, it was indeed but of
little force; but I obſerved its Poles to lie level with the
<hi>Laminae,</hi> of which it was compoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> A ſtrong Load-Stone ought to have large Irons, and
a weak one but thin Irons; ſo that a Stone may be over-ſhod.</p>

it was not poſſible for them to continue the Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Memoirs, as they had

            <p>He gave me alſo the Stamps of the Heads of <hi>Zenobia</hi> and
<hi>Vabalathus,</hi> done from the King's Medals. <hi>See Tab.</hi> 2. Theſe
were deſigned for a ſhort Hiſtory of all <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61013:56"/>the Emperors
and Empreſſes, which he has by him written in <hi>French,</hi> but not
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht. Nothing could be more Civil and Franc than this Gentleman, whom I
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be the beſt Medaliſt in <hi>Europe;</hi> he told me he had made
12 Voyages all over <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia Minor</hi> on purpoſe;
That he had ſeen and deſcribed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of more Cabinets, than any Man
ever did before him; and it is evident by his Works, that he has made good
uſe of them.</p>
            <p>I had a Viſit from Mr. <hi>Conningham,</hi> Tutor to my Lord
<hi>Lorne,</hi> a very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Curious Man in Books. I askt him (knowing
him to have been lately at <hi>Rome</hi>) very particularly about the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of Monſieur <hi>d'Azout.</hi> He told me, that he ſee him not above half a
year before he died, and was very intimately acquainted with him, and ſaw him
for a Twelvemonth very often. That he told him, that he had about 80 difficult
Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> which he had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and Explained; and
the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a great number of <hi>Errata</hi> in the Text. Alſo that
upon <hi>Julius Frontinus</hi> (though that was a much leſs Book) he had much
more to ſay, than he had upon <hi>Vitruvius:</hi> What is become of his
Papers I could not learn from him, nor any in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:61013:57"/>Monſieur <hi>d'Azout</hi> was very Curious
and Underſtanding in Architecture, for which purpoſe he was 17 years in
<hi>Italy</hi> by times; I do remember when he was in <hi>England</hi> about 14
years ago, he ſhewed me the Deſign of ſeveral of our Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings drawn by
himſelf; but of that of the <hi>Banquetting-Houſe</hi> at
<hi>Whitehall,</hi> he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf in very extraordinary Terms,
telling me, it was the moſt Regular, and moſt Finiſht Piece of Modern
Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he had ſeen on this ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> that he could
not enough praiſe it: That <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> the Architect, had a true
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of what was Noble in that Art.</p>
            <p>It is time now to leave the Private Houſes, and to Viſit the
<hi>Publick Libraries;</hi> and with them ſuch Perſons as are more
particularly concerned in the Hiſtory of Learning.</p>

<hi>l'Abbe Drouine</hi> came to viſit me at my Lodgings. I returned the
Viſit the next day at his Appartment in the College <hi>de Boncourt.</hi> He
had 4 or 5 little Rooms well furniſht with Books; in the biggeſt he had a
Collection of Catalogues of Books, and of all ſuch who had writ the Accounts
of Authors; above 3000 in all Languages. He told me he had ſtudied the
Hiſtory of Books with the <pb n="101" facs="tcp:61013:57"/>utmoſt application 18 years,
and had brought his <hi>Memoirs</hi> into a good Method; That he had thoughts
of Printing the firſt Tome this year, which would be of the moſt ancient
Authors, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin;</hi> That he intended to continue them
throughout all the ſucceeding Ages down to our times; which he ſaid he had
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in good part.</p>
            <p>He ſhewed me the Catalogue of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in 4 very thick
<hi>Folio's;</hi> alphabeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally diſpoſed by <hi>Family Names,</hi> under
ſome ſuch Title as this: <hi>Index alphabeticus omnium Scriptorum,
cujuſcunque facultatis temporis, &amp; linguae:</hi> Thoſe came to about
150000.</p>
            <p>He alſo ſhewed me his Alphabetick Memoirs in Sheets of the
Authors and Books they had writ, and in great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs. And laſtly, the
Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Catalogue, in which form he intends to Print the whole.</p>
            <p>He is a very Civil and well Tempered Perſon, very Learned and
Curious, and of a middle Age, fit to continue and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch a Laborious
Work. I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely obliged to him for his frequent Viſits.</p>

                  <hi>Thevenot</hi>'s
Library.</note>I was to wait on Monſieur <hi>Gurnier,</hi> one of the Heirs
of Monſieur <hi>Thevenot,</hi> to ſee the Remains of that Famous Man's
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary. There are a great number of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental</hi> MSS. yet unſold.</p>
            <p>He ſhewed me the MS. of <hi>Abulfeda,</hi> with its <hi>Latin</hi>
Verſion, done by Monſieur <hi>Thevenot;</hi> and the <hi>Matrices and Forms
of Arabick Letters,</hi> which he had, at his own Charge, cauſed to be cut
for the Printing of certain proper Names in it.</p>
            <p>He went or deſigned to go into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and
<hi>Holland</hi> to get it Printed, but was called back by Monſieur
<hi>Louvois</hi>'s Order, to Print it in <hi>France</hi> at the King's Charge;
but the late Wars coming on, it was ſet aſide, and is like to be ſo, for
he was turned out of his place of Library Keeper to the King, and died in
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
            <p>Thoſe great number of Oriental Books he had moſt from his
Nephew, whom he ſent abroad for that purpoſe, and who died in his
Travels.</p>
            <p>This Man was, as it were, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Academie des
Sciences,</hi> and was in his own Nature very Liberal, and gave Penſions to
many Scholars.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things, I ſaw there a large Dictionary and Grammar
of the <pb n="103" facs="tcp:61013:58"/>
               <hi>Algonquin Tongue,</hi> one of the Nations of
the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> The Fugitive Jeſuit, who writ it, dwelt amongſt
them 20 years. Here it alſo ſaw a Hiſtory, with large and accurate
Deſcriptions of the <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> of that part of the
<hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> by the ſame Author.</p>
            <p>As for the Papers of <hi>Swammerdam,</hi> which indeed were the
things I moſt coveted to ſee, they were much beneath my Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not
anſwering the Printed Catalogue of <hi>Thevenot, p.</hi> 239. There were,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſome Corrections of the Figures of his general Hiſtory of
Inſects, and ſome Additions, as though he intended ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Edition of that
Book.</p>
            <p>Alſo towards a particular Hiſtory, there were ſome ſmall
Treatiſes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome Figures only of the <hi>Tadpole.</hi> Again,
Figures relating to the Natural Hiſtory of a certain <hi>Day Butterfly;</hi>
Of the <hi>Aſilus;</hi> Of the <hi>Scuttle Fiſh;</hi> Of the <hi>Scarabaeus
Naſicornis;</hi> and ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of <hi>Snails,</hi> as
well naked, as fluviatil, and Sea diſſected; at leaſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured with their
Bodies exerted, and ſome of their Bowels extracted; and which ſeemed to me
to be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and delineated. There were 2 or 3 Stitcht Books in
<hi>Dutch</hi> of 4 or 5 Sheets a-piece belonging to thoſe Plates or
Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. <pb n="104" facs="tcp:61013:59"/>But the Gentleman would not part with any of
them; becauſe, he ſaid, they had been ſecured by the <hi>Abbot
Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> for the Kings uſe. However, all theſe I judge well worth
Printing, when it ſhall pleaſe that <hi>Society</hi> to do it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I ſaw in his Cuſtody a fair MS. of <hi>Michael
Servetus,</hi> with a Treatiſe at the end of it, which, as he ſaid, was
never publiſht; being a Compariſon of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Law, its
Juſtice and Charity.</p>

               <note place="margin">Kings' Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary.</note>Monſ. <hi>l'Abbe de
Brillac,</hi> Almoner to the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> very obligingly offered
to carry me to the <hi>Kings Library;</hi> but I Civilly declined it, for I had
been told, it was better to make Viſits by ones ſelf: for no Stranger but
was very welcome, at all times; not only on the days it was publickly open, as
it is upon <hi>Tueſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monſ. <hi>Clemènt,</hi> the Deputy Library Keeper, made us
welcome, and invited us to come again, and ſpend a whole day with him: He
made me in particular a very great Compliment, as a conſiderable Benefactor
to that place, ſhewing me moſt of the Books and the Names of the reſt, I
had publiſht in <hi>Latin;</hi> and ſhewed a great ſatisfaction, that he
had got the <pb n="105" facs="tcp:61013:59"/>
               <hi>Synopſis Conchyliorum,</hi> which he had
cauſed to be Bound very elegantly. I told him, that I was very ſorry to
ſee it there, and wondered how he came by it; for it was, I aſſured him,
but a very imperfect trial of the Plates, which I had diſpoſed of to ſome
few Friends only, till I ſhould be able to cloſe and finiſh the Deſign;
which I now had done to my power, and would redeem that Book with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Copy at my return into <hi>England:</hi> The ſame Promiſe I renewed to the
<hi>Abbe Louvois,</hi> the Library Keeper, at his own Inſtance, when I had
the Honour to Dine with him. This young Gentleman is Brother to Monſieur
<hi>Barbiſieux,</hi> Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the Affairs of War; he takes great care to
apply himſelf to his Studies, and for that purpoſe has two of the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
conſtantly with him to inſtruct him. He lives great, and has a Houſe
which joins upon the King's Library, of which he is Keeper. We were Entertained
by him with all the Civility imaginable, and freedom of Converſation.</p>
            <p>This Library is now placed in a Private Houſe, and taken out of
the <hi>Louvre,</hi> but it is intended to be removed to the <hi>Place de
Vendoſme,</hi> where one ſide of that Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicent Square is deſigned
for it. In the mean time it is here moſt commodiouſly <pb n="106" facs="tcp:61013:60"/>diſpos'd into 22 Rooms; 14 above Stairs, and 8 below and above.
Thoſe below are Philoſophy and Phyſick, and the Shelves are Wired, to
ſecure them: Above are the Books of Philoſophy and Human Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it
is into thoſe Rooms only the promiſcous Crowd are admitted twice a week. In
the middle Rooms, which makes the great Body of the Library, are, for Example,
Catalogues of Books; Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories in one of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Holland;</hi> in another the Hiſtories of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Germany;</hi> in another the Hiſtories of <hi>Italy, Spain, &amp;c.</hi>
in other Bibles of all ſorts, and the Interpretations; in another <hi>Greek
MSS.</hi> in another <hi>Latin MSS.</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Civil and Municipial
Laws of all Nations; in another the Original Papers of State; in another
<hi>Stamps,</hi> where, by the by, the King had the Collection of Monſ.
<hi>Marolles</hi> to divert him, in one of his Sickneſſes, bought in at a
vaſt Sum: The Catalogue alone of theſe Stamps, no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than two ſmall
Almanacks, coſt me 14 Livres; ſo much Strangers are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by the
Crafty Bookſellers of <hi>Rue St. Jaques;</hi> but 'tis not in
<hi>France</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, where People are made to pay for their Humour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:61013:60"/>They have Two Indexes of this Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; one
relating to the Matter and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Books; and another Index of Authors,
wherein are all the Works they have of them, and the Titles of all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that they know of, that are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with an <hi>Aſteriſm</hi> to ſuch
in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; which is well done, that they may know what they have to buy
in. It is indeed a vaſt Collection, and worthy ſo great a Prince. This
Library conſiſts at leaſt of 50000 Volumes of Printed Books; and 15000
MSS. in all Languages.</p>
            <p>They work daily and hard at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, which they intend to
Print; I ſaw 10 thick Folio's of it, fairly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd for the Preſs.
It is diſpoſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Subject Matter of the Books, as the Bibles
and Expoſitors, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Philoſophers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to put it into the Preſs this years, and to finiſh it within a
Twelvemonth.</p>
            <p>In the King's Library I was ſhewn an Ancient <hi>Greek MS. of
Dioſcorides,</hi> writ in a ſort of thin or narrow Capitals, with the
Plants painted in Water-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; but the firſt Book was wholly wanting, and
therefore the <hi>Animals</hi> not there, which yet was what I moſt deſired
to ſee; for there are ſome things relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, which we are at this
day in <pb n="108" facs="tcp:61013:61"/>great doubt of; and it would have been ſome
ſatisfaction to have ſeen by the Pictures, what the middle Ages, at
leaſt, had thought of them.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Room alſo we were ſhewn the Epiſtles; which was
one part of the ſame MS. which we have at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which is the
Goſpels only. <hi>Beza</hi> was poſſeſſed of ours, from whom we had
it. It is written in <hi>ſquare Capitals,</hi> and very ſhort Lines, and
much worn out in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places. This comes much ſhort of the
<hi>Alexandrian</hi> MS. at <hi>St. James's</hi> for Beauty and Antiquity.</p>
            <p>There was another <hi>MS. of the Goſpel of St. Matthew,</hi> which
was but of late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; a very fair Volume in a large Folio. This was
cut to pieces in the back, and had been ſhuffled and bound up again; and
another Book overwritten in a ſmall Modern <hi>Greek</hi> Hand, about 150
years ago. The firſt Writing was turned ſo pale, that they took no pains to
rub it out. One of the Library Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers obſerving this, hath reduced it again
by paging it a-new; and with a little heeding 'tis yet very legible. The Letter
is as fair a ſquare Capital as any I have ſeen. There are ſome
Interpretations ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notorious, as about the Deſcent of the ſick Man into
the Pool of <hi>Betheſda;</hi> 
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:61013:61"/>which I ſuppoſe will
be accounted for by the Induſtrious and Learned Collator.</p>
            <p>I obſerved the <hi>China</hi> Manuſcripts which Father
<hi>Beauvais</hi> brought this year as a Preſent to the King. They are about
44 Packs of ſmall Books, of a long Quarto faſhion, put up in looſe Covers
of a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Sattin glued on Paſtboard; of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtory, of
Dictionaries relating to the Expoſition of their Characters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King had a Sett much of the ſame before in White-Sattin, with
their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</p>
            <p>Here alſo I ſee the 3d Decade of <hi>Livy,</hi> a large Quarto
in Vellum, without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Words in fair large Capitals. It is
ſuppoſed by Monſieur <hi>Baluze</hi> to be 1100 year old.</p>
            <p>Yet the Manuſcript of <hi>Prudentius Hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> which was
alſo ſhewed us, is a much fairer Letter, and therefore thought to be older
by one Century at leaſt.</p>
            <p>Here alſo I ſaw a famous <hi>Latin Roll</hi> or Volume written
of Aegyptian Paper, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Charta Plenariae Securitatis,</hi> taken
the 38th years of <hi>Juſtinian;</hi> it is fanly Ingraved and Interpreted
Letter by Letter upon Copper by <hi>Monſieur Thevenot.</hi> I ſaw the Print
thereof: It is writ long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Roll and not croſs; in three Columns: The
Column in the middle is <pb n="110" facs="tcp:61013:62"/>three times as long as the two end
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns. The Roll is not above a foot broad.</p>
            <p>They ſhewed us alſo in this Houſe, the Apartment of Monſieur
<hi>Hugeins,</hi> which was very Noble, and well for Air, upon the Garden: But
here he fell Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Died of it in <hi>Holland.</hi> He ſhewed the
firſt Tokens of it by playing with a Tame Sparrow, and neglecting his
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematick Schemes. 'Tis certain, Life and Health of Body and Mind are not to
be preſerved but by the Relaxation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bending the Mind by Innocent
Diverſions. For Sleep is nothing elſe that I know off, but the giving up
the Reins, and letting Nature to Act alone, and to put her in full
poſſeſſion of the Body. We have a convincing inſtance of this, in
being a Bed awake: No Man can lie ſtill 3 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes without turning; and if it
come not preſently upon us, we muſt turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again; and at length we
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo intolerably weary, that our Bed is a very wrack to us. Whereas, if
we chance to fall a ſleep, though we lie in one and the ſame poſture 7
hours, we ſhall Wake freſh and without pain, as tho' the Body did not weigh
at all upon it ſelf in Sleep. 'Tis certain, the Nerves and Muſcles are in
little or no Tenſion <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61013:62"/>in Sleep; but when we are awake,
are always ſtretch'd and compreſſed, whence wearineſs: which, if upon
our Feet or Sitting, we are not ſenſible off, becauſe we remove quick and
with eaſe, and of courſe; but laid, we ſoon find our ſelves very
uneaſie, till we change the poſture.</p>
            <p>But this is not all in the King's Library: There are other things to
be ſeen, <hi>viz.</hi> A conſiderable number of Ancient Roman and Aegyptian
Antiquities; as, <hi>Lamps, Pateras,</hi> and other Veſſels belonging to
the Sacrifices; A <hi>Siſtrum</hi> or Aegyptian Rattle with three looſe and
running Wires croſs it.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the great variety of <hi>Aegyptian Idols,</hi> there was
one betwixt 2 and 3 foot long of Black Touch-ſtone, with Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks
ingraven down before. I took particular notice of the Grain of this Stone; and
at my return, having had the Honour of a Paper from Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> from
<hi>Dublin,</hi> giving an account of the vaſt and ſtupendious <hi>Natural
Pillars</hi> to be ſeen in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that the Stones or Joints
which conſtitute theſe Pillars, are of the <hi>Lapis Lydius,</hi> or
<hi>Baſaltes</hi> Kind, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen one of the Joints at
<hi>Greſham-Colledge,</hi> I eaſily agree with him; but much admire, that
the <hi>Peble Kind</hi> ſhould produce ſuch regular Figures; which is
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <pb n="112" facs="tcp:61013:63"/>the very hardeſt Stone to be found in
<hi>Europe,</hi> and which no Tool of ours will cut.</p>
            <p>This alſo is another Inſtance (the carved Oblisks being one) of
the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent make and goodneſs of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Chiſels, of
which, and of the retrieving the ancient Temper of Steel, I have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht a
Diſcourſe in the <hi>Ph. Tranſactions</hi> ſome years ago.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have had more ſatisfaction in this Kind, had I met with
what I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſought for, the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Tombs, which were a
long time in the Garden of Monſieur <hi>Valentine</hi> at <hi>Paris;</hi> but
were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily ſent away to his Houſe at <hi>Tours,</hi> not long before
our coming to <hi>Paris:</hi> One of theſe Tombs is ſaid to be of black
Touchſtone, to have been brought out of the higher <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and to be
full of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogliphicks.</hi> Of this in particular <hi>Kircher</hi> has
written.</p>
            <p>There is in this Collection a large Piece of <hi>Tin Oar</hi> from
<hi>England,</hi> very curious; it has on one ſide of it a great number of
fair and large Opaque Cryſtals of Tin, ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like poliſht Steel: The
<hi>plaines</hi> of thoſe Cryſtals I could not eaſily reckon, but ſure
I am, having with care examined all the Stone Cryſtals, I could meet with,
both precious and more common, and <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61013:63"/>alſo the Cryſtals
of all Foſſil Salts, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before obſerved that figure in any of them,
but believe them of a peculiar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, proper to Tin Oar. I call them
Cryſtals, though Opaque, becauſe angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and of one conſtant figure.</p>

the Windows are not over large; with Tables under each Light, very

            <p>Both he and <hi>Valliant</hi> agreed, that they had never ſeen any

            <p>
               <hi>P. Daniel</hi> is Library Keeper; and was very Civil to me; he
ſhewed me a Letter, which he had juſt then received from Monſ.
<hi>Huetius,</hi> the Learned Biſhop of <hi>d'Auranches</hi> near <hi>Mont
St. Michaels</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi> wherein he told him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lately received the Catalogues of Books Printed in <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> during the War; he found, that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was much alike at a

life and vigour in <hi>England,</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at.</p>
            <p>And, indeed, I had had the ſame thought from more of the French

               </note>I ſaw
the Quire of the Abbey of <hi>St. Germains,</hi> and the Altar near the lower
end of it; in which Poſition alſo I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have ſeen an Altar in
the Quire of <hi>St. John</hi>'s Church at <hi>Lions;</hi> both plain Tables.
Monſ. <hi>l'Abbe de Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi> who has an Apartment in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, a
Learned Man, went with me, and to the Library alſo; which is two large
Galleries well furniſht; at the end of one of them is a large Cloſet of
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts; alſo another <hi>Armoir</hi> in the great Library, where the
moſt ancient <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61013:66"/>Manuſcripts are kept, yet with more care.
In this I ſaw the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> as it is believed, of <hi>St.
Germain,</hi> who lived in the 6th Century; it is certainly very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
being a large Quarto of fine purple Velom, and on it are writ the
<hi>Pſalms</hi> in large Capital Letters, with Comma's or Points. The Letters
ſeem to have been of Silver; and the great Initial Capitals of Gold.</p>
            <p>They ſhew alſo a <hi>Pſalter</hi> in the ſhort Notes of
<hi>Tyro, Tullius</hi>'s <hi>Libertus;</hi> with a Diſcourſe concerning the
uſe of ſuch Short Hand in the beginning of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript; it was writ
very fair on Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, with red Ink, as I remember.</p>
            <p>The Codicils or Waxen Table Books of the Ancients; which were thin
Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar Boards about 14 inches long, and 5 broad, 6 or 8 of them glued together
by Shreds of Parchmen; The Rims were a little raiſed, with a flat and broad
Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the better to preſerve the black Wax, which was ſpread over them.
I ſaw more of theſe afterwards in the King's Library; and by the Letter it
is manifeſt, they were in uſe much later, than I could have imagined. This
here was in <hi>Latin,</hi> and I could read here and there a Word, for the
ground was much torn up, as <hi>Pro duobus Falconibus, &amp;c.</hi> The Style
or Steel <pb n="119" facs="tcp:61013:66"/>Pen had cut through in many places; ſo that
with a good Eye-glaſs I could ſee the board bare. I take this paſt to be
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but what the <hi>Etchers</hi> in Copper uſe at this day to
cover their Plates with, to defend from the <hi>Aqua-fortis;</hi> which is a
Compoſition of Bitumen and Bees Wax.</p>
            <p>Here alſo I ſaw a Manuſcript of 3 or 4 Leaves written upon
true <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Paper, in which with an Eye-glaſs 'twas eaſie to
diſcern, how the flags were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, length-ways and a-croſs, one
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another. The Letters which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, which were but few, were large and

they have.</p>

               </note>I Viſited in this

of the Commonwealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Writings, and particularly that
Excellent Book <hi>De re Diplomaticâ;</hi> he ſeemed to me to be a very
good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and Free-hearted Man; and was very well pleaſed to hear, that
our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manuſcripts was ſo forward in the
Preſs at <hi>Oxford.</hi> He thankfully owned the favour of the
<hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Library; and was very ſorry to hear of Dr.
<hi>Bernard</hi>'s Death, of whom he <pb n="120" facs="tcp:61013:67"/>ſpoke very kindly;
but he expreſſed a wonderful Eſteem for Dr. <hi>Gale,</hi> the Dean of
<hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another Converſation I had with <hi>P. Mabillon,</hi> (for he
was my Neighbour, and I was often with him) telling him the Account we had
brought us of <hi>Palmyra,</hi> and the Tracts that were writ of it, and that
more was intended to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht about it, he was much concerned, that
thoſe Accounts, which were pure Matters of Learning in general, were written
in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and he told me, he was afraid it might be with us, as it
was with them, ſince they cultivated their own Language ſo much, they began
to neglect the ancient Tongues, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſhewed me certain Figures not ill taken with Red Chalk, of
ſome very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Monuments obſerved by ſome of the Fathers of their
Order; one of which was preſent in the Chamber, upon the Mountain of
<hi>Framond</hi> near <hi>Salme,</hi> which lies in the middle of that Tract of
the Mountain, called <hi>La Vauge,</hi> betwixt <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſace</hi> and
<hi>Lorraine.</hi> There were great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of an ancient City. Theſe
Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures which the Fathers ſhewed me, were about 12 in all; but 5 or 6 of
them were of <hi>Mercury;</hi> and Cock at his Foot; a <hi>Chla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys</hi> 
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:61013:67"/>knotted upon the Right Shoulder, hanging at his Back; his
Hair laid in curles about his Face, and tied with a Ribban, whoſe two ends
might be ſeen on the top of his Head, like Horns; a <hi>Caduceus</hi> in his
Hand, which was very differently repreſented in all the Figures of him;
ſometimes held up, othertimes the point reſting at his Feet; ſometimes
the Snakes were twiſted about a Stick; and again in others without one, or
the Deſigner had taken no notice of it; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Tail of the Serpents
ſpread and flying about, and again in others cloſe twiſted with many
braids; a Girdle came round the bottom of his Belly, and which had in the
middle of it two Rings, one faſtned to the other, and hanging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his
Legs. Theſe many <hi>Statues</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> in a <hi>French</hi>
Country are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſays of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

            </p>
            <p>There were ſome few <hi>Roman</hi> Letters on ſome of them,

               <note place="margin">Library of <hi>St. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieue.</hi>
               </note>The

ſides up to the top, and kept in Caſes wired with Braſs; which is a good

            <p>Alſo it is adorned with fair <hi>Buſto's</hi> of the ancient Men
of Learning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Muſaeum</hi> is a little Cloſet on the ſide of this
Gallery; of which there is a Book lately publiſht: I ſaw in it very little

            <p>There we ſaw an ancient <hi>As,</hi> with <hi>Etruſcan

            <p>
               <hi>As quaſi Aes;</hi> This is very reaſonable, for before the

            <p>But nothing pleaſed me more than to have ſeen the Remains of the
Cabinet of the <hi>Noble Piereſc.</hi> the greateſt and heartieſt
<hi>Maecenas</hi> to his power of Learned Men of any of this Age.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the firſt and very old Braſs <hi>Roman</hi> Coins
there was a <hi>Sextans</hi> with a Caduceus of <hi>Mercury</hi> on one ſide,
and a <hi>Scallop Shell on the other;</hi> probably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might have
at firſt had the uſe of <hi>Shell Money,</hi> as ſome parts of both the

whoſe Emblem that Staff is, taught them the uſe of <hi>Metallic
Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo in this Cabinet are Wet Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as the Ancient
<hi>Congius,</hi> of which they have an old one, and an exact Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of that of

Now the <hi>Congius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 120 Ounces The <hi>Sextarius</hi> 20
Ounces; The <hi>Hemina</hi> 10 Ounces; The <hi>Quartarius</hi> 5 Ounces, I
doubt not but the <hi>Cyathus,</hi> by reaſon of the aforeſaid Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
held two Ounces and an half; which is the Meaſure ſo frequently to be met
with in old Phyſic Authors, and of ſo great concern in
<hi>Doſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:61013:69"/>In that <hi>Hetruſcan As</hi>
before-mentioned, one Cap coifs or covers the double head of <hi>Janus.</hi> I
ſaw an ancient Statue of <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Garden belonging to the
Kings Library in <hi>Paris,</hi> where <hi>Mercury</hi> has upon his Head a
long Cap doubled, or laid double upon his Head, as though there were ſome
affinity betwixt thoſe two Inventors of Trade, Arts and Learning.</p>
            <p>Here alſo we ſaw the <hi>Steel Dyes of the Paduan Brothers,</hi>
by which they ſtampt and falſified the beſt ancient Medals ſo well,
that they are not to be diſtinguiſht but by putting them into thoſe
Molds; which makes them very valuable, there being a 100 and more of them, and
are priſed at 10000 Crowns. They Stampt upon old Medals, whereby the Cheat
was the greater; for by this means they were of the ancient Mettal, had the
green Coat, and the ſame ragged Edges.</p>
            <p>I ſaw a Picture here of about 6 inches over, finely painted in
<hi>Moſaic,</hi> the very little ſquares were ſcarce viſible to the
naked Eye, but the whole appeared like the fineſt Hatchings in
<hi>Stampes;</hi> yet by the application of a good Eye-glaſs, I could readily
diſtinguiſh the ſquares of all colours, as in other <hi>Moſaiques.</hi>
This ſort of Painting had a very admirable effect, beſides the
duration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:61013:69"/>Here was alſo the <hi>Leg of a Mummi</hi>
well preſerv'd, the Toes only bare, black and ſhining as Pitch: The Bandage
was very curious and was diſpoſed in Oblique Circles, Decuſſated; but
the Fillating very narrow. I told the Father, that this was ſtill Fleſh;
and that Mummie therefore in <hi>Venice</hi>-Treacle did break Lent, if given
at that time; He anſwered, he did not believe it: I told him how he ſhould
be convinced, <hi>viz.</hi> If that Leg was kept a good while in a damp Cellar,
it would yield and ſtink like very Carrion, tho' it was at leaſt 3000 years
old; which thing happened to one in <hi>London,</hi> ſo careleſly laid
by.</p>
            <p>There was one thing very curious, and that was an Ancient
<hi>Writing Inſtrument</hi> of thick and ſtrong Silver-Wire, wound up like
a hollow Bottom or Screw; with both the Ends pointing one way, and at a

Points, and the Screw fills the Ball of his Hand. One of the Points was the
Point of a Bodkin, which was to Write on Waxed Tables: The other Point was made
very Artificially, like the Head and Upper-Beak of a Cock, and the Point
divided in two, juſt like our <hi>Steel-Pens;</hi> from whence undoubtedly
the Moderns had <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61013:70"/>their Patterns; which are now made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

are therefore not ſo uſeful as of Steel, or a Quill: But a Quill ſoon
ſpoils; Steel is undoubtedly the beſt, and if you uſe <hi>China</hi> Ink,
the moſt laſting of all Inks, it never ruſts the Pen, but rather
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it with a kind of Varniſh which dries upon it, though you take

               <note place="margin">M. <hi>Colberts</hi> Library.</note>I ſaw the
Library of the late Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> that great Patron of Learning.
The Gallery wherein the Printed Books are kept, is a Ground-Room, with Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
on one ſide only, a-long a fine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. It is the neateſt Library in
<hi>Paris,</hi> very large, and exceedingly well furniſht. At the upper-end

the Adminiſtration of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and his own Accounts when

Maroquin and Gilt.</p>
            <p>The Manuſcript Library is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtairs, in three Rooms, and is

Letters.</p>
            <p>Alſo the <hi>Miſſa Beati Rhenani,</hi> whereof all the Copies
were burnt but four. The Original Deed of the Agreement of the Greek and Roman
Church at <hi>Florence.</hi> The <hi>Regalia</hi> agreed upon at
<hi>Lyons,</hi> and many others which I have forgot.</p>
            <p>I ſaw neither Greek nor Latin Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript but what had the Marks
of the Goths upon them: that is, the Letters maimed, and conſequently not
very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
            <p>He ſhewed us <hi>Servieto</hi>'s Book, for which he was Burnt at
<hi>Geneva;</hi> which coſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> at an Auction in

Libri</hi> 7. <hi>per Michaelam Serveto alias Reves ab Aragonia Hiſpanum</hi>
1531. I had forgot the particular place where the Circulation of the Blood
through the Lungs is mentioned: but he told me very Civilly, I ſhould have it
Tranſcribed at any time.</p>
            <p>We told him, we came to ſee him as well as the Library: He
replied, It was his hap to have more Reputation than <pb n="128" facs="tcp:61013:71"/>Merit. He was a little old Man, but very chearful and of a quick
Wit.</p>
            <p>He complained much of the Refuſal of the Emperor's People
concerning the Manuſcripts of <hi>Vienna,</hi> in order to the publication of
the <hi>Capitulaires:</hi> For he ſaid, Letters were never at War: That for
his part he had moſt willingly given leave for at leaſt Twenty four

            <p>Amongſt the Illuminations and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Pictures in the Margent,
I could not but take notice of a <hi>Braſs Cannon</hi> fired, well Painted,
with two large Arms or Gudgeons, one on each ſide near the

            <p>This Manuſcript confirms the loſs of <hi>Titus Livy,</hi> and
that it was deficient in that Age, as to what is now wanting, there being
nothing more in this than what is in the Printed Copy. This was the Gift of
Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary; who in a manner Rebuilt the whole
College, and Beautified it as it is. His Tomb is in the middle of the Quire,

            <p>The Catalogue was not finiſht, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Printed; which

               </note>I was to Viſit
<hi>Pere Mallebranche</hi> of the Fathers of the Oratory: They live very neatly
together in a kind of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but under no Rule: He was very handſomely
lodged, in a Room well furniſht: He is a very tall, lean man, of a ready Wit

            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:61013:73"/>After an hours diſcourſe, he carried me
into the <hi>Publick Library</hi> of the Houſe: A fair Gallery well lighted,
and well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with Books; with an Apartment at the upper end for
Manuſcripts, where were many Greek and Hebrew. Amongſt the reſt, the
Library-Keeper ſhewed us the <hi>Samaritan Pentateuch,</hi> of which
<hi>Morin</hi> made uſe. It ſeemed to me to be much later than that of Sir
<hi>John Cotton</hi>'s Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with us, becauſe it was of a much ſmaller
Letter, and more broken in the Writing, which was all I am capable to judge
by.</p>
            <p>They were buſie in Reforming the Diſpoſition of the Library;
and making a good Catalogue, according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the late Archbiſhop
of <hi>Rheims;</hi> and which I like well of, they had drawn out ſome
Hundreds of Books, and expoſed them in the middle of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, upon a
long Table, for Sale, as being Duplicates; and from the Sale of them to
furniſh themſelves with what they wanted.</p>
            <p>The Books which were written by Proteſtants, I obſerved, they
were lockt up in Wired Caſes, not to be come at without particular leave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:61013:73"/>The Freedom and Nature of this Order puts me in
mind of what I heard of a certain rich and learned Man, Monſieur
<hi>Pinet,</hi> of the Law; who put himſelf at length into Religion, as they
ſay, amongſt the Fathers; but firſt perſuaded his Cook to do ſo too;
for he was reſolved not to quit his good Soupes, and ſuch Diſhes as he
liked, whatever became of his Penance and Retirement. This Compliment the
Elegant and Learned Monſieur <hi>Peletier,</hi> in Monſieur
<hi>Colbert</hi>'s place, Controller Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Finances,</hi> made
his Gueſts at his Country Houſe near <hi>Choiſy,</hi> having voluntarily
quitted all his Imployments at Court: He ſaid, He reſerved his Cook, tho'
he retrencht the reſt of his Retinue; they might therefore expect a ſlender
Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers Dinner, tho' well dreſt.</p>
            <p>It is wonderful to conſider how moſt of the reſt of the Orders
<hi>abuſe</hi> themſelves for God's Sake, as they call it. Hunger and
Ill-Diet not only deſtroys a Man's Health, but Maugre all his Devotion, puts
him out of Humour, and makes him Repine and Envy the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and
well if it do not make him alſo Curſe in his Heart his Maker; <hi>Job</hi>
is not every Man's Roll to Act. The Original and Riſe of Natural Philoſophy
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61013:74"/>and Phyſick was to Invent a more whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and better
Food, than the Beaſts have, and to Eat Bread and Fleſh inſtead of Herbs
and Corn; to Drink Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Water; thoſe, and a thouſand other
things were the Bleſſings of Phyſick, and ſtill the good management of
theſe things, both in Health and Sickneſs, are under the Directions of the
Phyſitians. Now for a ſort of <hi>Melancholly</hi> and <hi>Willful
Men,</hi> to renounce theſe Comforts, and deſtroy their Healths, and all
this upon a pretended Principle of Religion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, ſeems to me, I
confeſs, great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to God the Author of it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I heartily pitied <hi>F. P.</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious honeſt
Man, after his return from the <hi>Indies,</hi> who was nothing but Skin and
Bone; and yet by the Rules of his Order he could not Eat any thing that was
wholſome and proper for his Cure; nothing but a little ſlimy naſty Fiſh
and Herbs: And tho' he took, as he told me, <hi>Hypocochoana</hi> five times,
it had no effect upon him. 'Tis true, I never heard him complain; But what will
not blind prejudice do againſt all the Reaſon of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:61013:74"/>I know ſome of theſe Men have been uſeful
to Mankind by their Studies; but the very ſame men would have been much more,
had they ſtaid with their Neighbours, and Taught the World by their
Converſation and Example; Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Juſtice, and Innocence, and
Temperance, which they highly pretend to, are not things to be hid in Corners,
but to be brought forth to Inſtruct and Adorn the Age we live in: To abandon
the World, and all the Conveniencies of Life and Health, is (let them ſay
what they pleaſe) the height of Chagrin, and not Religion.</p>
            <p>There were ſome other Publick Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I ſaw, as that of the
<hi>Grands Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins,</hi> Colledge <hi>Mazarin,</hi> Colledge
<hi>Navarre,</hi> and great many more I did not ſee for want of an
opportunity; but there is nothing particular I remember about them.</p>
            <p>There is ſuch a paſſion of ſetting up for Libraries, that
Books are come to moſt unreaſonable Rates.</p>
            <p>I paid to <hi>Aniſſon</hi> 36 Livres for <hi>Nizo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi> 20
Livres for the Two ſmall Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's of the Memoirs of the <hi>Academie de
Sciences,</hi> that is, as I may ſay, for two years Philoſophick
Tranſactions; for they began thoſe Monthly Memoirs in <pb n="136" facs="tcp:61013:75"/>imitation of ours, out of the Regiſters of the Academy, but did not
think fit to continue them above two years.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Stamps,</hi> I had a mind to have bought a compleat Set of
<hi>Melans,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Maſter; but I was askt 200 Livres, and 12
excepted, which might amount to as much more; for ſome of his Gravings in
<hi>Octavo</hi> done at <hi>Rome,</hi> they askt me a Piſtol a-piece; and for
the Head of <hi>Juſtinianus</hi> a Louis; which yet is his
Maſter-piece.</p>
            <p>I was at an Auction of Books in the <hi>Ruë St. Jaques,</hi>
where were about 40 or 50 People, moſt Abbots and Monks. The Books were
ſold with a great deal of trifling and delay as with us, and very dear; for
<hi>Hiſpania illuſtrata Aud. Sciotti,</hi> of the <hi>Francfort</hi>
Edition, from 20 Livres, at which it was ſet, they bid up by little and
little to 36 Livres; at which it was ſold. The next was a <hi>Catalogue of
French Books</hi> in a thin Fol. in an old Parchment Cover by <hi>De la Croix
de Maine,</hi> 8 Livres. And ſo I left them to ſhift it amongſt
themſelves.</p>
            <p>After having ſaid ſo much of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Libraries,</hi> I
cannot but congratulate their happineſs, to have them ſo well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from Fire; it being one of the Perfections of this City to be ſo built and 
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61013:75"/>furniſht, as not to have ſuffered by it theſe many
Ages; and, indeed, I cannot ſee how Malice it ſelf could deſtroy them,
for the Houſes here are all built of Stone, Walls, Floors, Staircaſes and
all, ſome few Rooms excepted; no Wainſcot; Woollen or Silk Hangings, which
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fired without giving notice by the intolerable ſtench, and the
ſupply of much Fuel. 'Tis well for us in <hi>London,</hi> that there are very
few publick Libraries, and thoſe ſmall and inconſiderable, and that the
great number of Books are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into a thouſand hands, (no Country
in <hi>Europe</hi> can compare to us for private Libraries) for if they were
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch vaſt quantities as in <hi>Paris,</hi> Learning would run
the hazard of daily ſuffering. Here with us, me-thinks, every Man that goes
to Bed, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, lies like a dead <hi>Roman</hi> upon a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pile,
dreading ſome unexpected <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis;</hi> for all is combuſtible
about him, and the Paint of the Deal Boards may ſerve for Incenſe, the
quicker to burn him to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>In the next place I will Account for what I ſaw, that ſeemed to
me ſingular and new in the Improvement of Arts, or wanting in our
Country.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Potterie</hi> of <hi>St. Clou.</hi>
               </note>I
ſaw the <hi>Potterie of St. Clou,</hi> with which I was marvellouſly well
pleaſed, for I confeſs I could not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Pots made
there, and the fineſt <hi>China Ware</hi> I ever ſaw. It will, I know, be
eaſily granted me, that the <hi>Paintings</hi> may be better deſigned and
finiſht, (as indeed it was) becauſe our Men are far better Maſters in
that Art, than the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes;</hi> but the <hi>Glazing</hi> came not in
the leaſt behind theirs, not for whiteneſs, nor the ſmoothneſs of
running without Bubles; again, the <hi>inward Subſtance</hi> and Matter of
the Pots was, to me, the very ſame, hard and firm as Marble, and the ſelf
ſame grain, <hi>on this ſide vitrification.</hi> Farther, the
<hi>Tranſparency</hi> of the Pots the very ſame.</p>
            <p>I ſee them alſo in the Mold, undried, and before the Painting
and Glazing was applied, they were as white as Chalk, and melted upon the
Tongue like raw To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco Pipe Clay, and felt betwixt the Teeth ſoft like
that, and very little grit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo that I doubt not, but they are made of that
very Clay.</p>
            <p>As to the Temper of the Clay, the Man freely owned to me, it was 3
or 4 times well beaten and wet, before it was put to work on the Wheel; but I
believe <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61013:76"/>it muſt firſt be melted in fair Water, and
carefully drawn off, that the heavieſt part may firſt ſink; which alſo
may be proper for Courſer Works.</p>
            <p>That it required two, and ſometimes 3 or 4 Fires to bake it, to
that height we ſaw it in the moſt finiſht Pots: Nay, ſome of them had
had 11 Fires.</p>
            <p>I did not expect to have found it in this perfection, but imagined
this might have arrived at the <hi>Gomron Ware;</hi> which is, indeed, little
elſe, but a total Vitrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but I found it far otherwiſe, and very
ſurpriſing, and which I account part of the felicity of the Age to equal,
if not ſurpaſs the <hi>Chineſes</hi> in their fineſt Art.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Red Ware</hi> for <hi>China,</hi> that has been, and
is done in <hi>England,</hi> to a far greater perfection than in
<hi>China,</hi> we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as good Materials, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Soft
Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matites,</hi> and far better Artiſts in Pottery. But in this particular
we are beholding to two <hi>Dutchmen</hi> Brothers, who wrought in
<hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> (as I have been told) and were not long ſince at
<hi>Hammerſmith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſold theſe Pots at <hi>St. Clou</hi> at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Rates; and for their ordinary Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate Cups askt Crowns a-piece. They had
arrived at the Burning on Gold in neat Chequer Works. He had ſome Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitures
of Tea Tables at 400 Livres a Sett.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:61013:77"/>There was no Molding or Model of <hi>China</hi>
Ware, which they had not imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and had added many Fancies of their own,
which had their good effects, and appeared very beautiful.</p>
            <p>Monſ. <hi>Morin</hi> in Converſation told me, that they kept
their Sand as a Secret to themſelves; but this could not be for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
purpoſes than Colouring: Alſo he ſaid they uſed Salt of <hi>Kelp</hi>
in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and made a thing not unlike <hi>Frit</hi> for Glaſs to
be wrought up with White Clay; neither could this be, for I did not taſte it
in the Raw Pots.</p>
            <p>The Ingenuous Maſter told me, he had been 25 years about the

'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a moſt conſiderable addition to the Glaſs-making. For I
ſaw here one Looking-glaſs foiled and finiſht, 88 inches long, and 48
inches broad; and yet but one quarter of an inch thick. This, I think, could
never be effected by the Blaſt of any Man; but I ſuppoſe to be

            <p>There they are poliſhed; which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys daily 600 Men, and they

a fine Tamis. In the Upper Gallery, where they poliſh and give the laſt
Hand, they work in 3 Rowes, and 2 Men at a Plate, with Ruddle or Powdered
Haematites in Water.</p>
            <p>The Glaſſes are ſet faſt in White Puttie, upon flat Tables
of Stone, ſawed thin for that purpoſe. The grinding the Edges and Borders
is very troubleſome, and odious for the horrid grating noiſe it makes, and
which cannot be endured to one that is not uſed to it; and yet by long
cuſtom theſe Fellows are ſo eaſie with it, that they Diſcourſe
together as nothing were. This is done below, and out of the way of the
reſt.</p>
            <p>'Tis very diverting to ſee the joint La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of ſo many Men upon
one Subject. This has made Glaſs for Coaches very <pb n="142" facs="tcp:61013:78"/>cheap
and common; ſo that even many of the <hi>Fiacres</hi> or Hackneys, and all

<hi>Bïoux</hi> made at <hi>Paris,</hi> a great quantity of <hi>Artificial
Pearl</hi> is to be had, of divers ſorts; but the beſt are thoſe which
are made with Scales of <hi>Bleakes.</hi> Theſe Bleaks they fiſh in the
River <hi>Seine</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſell them to the Pearl-makers for
that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Monſ. <hi>Favi,</hi> at the <hi>Pearle d'Angleterre,</hi> told me,
that he paid for the Fiſh only of the little River <hi>Yier of Ville Neuve
St. George,</hi> 4 Leagues off of <hi>Paris,</hi> by the year 110 Piſtols.
This Fiſh in <hi>French</hi> is called <hi>De la Bellette:</hi> Sometimes in
Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has had 30 Hampers of the Fiſh brought him, for the Scales only
which he uſes in Pearl-making. He ſells ſome Strings for a Piſtol; and
they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been ſold much dearer. This ſort is very neat and
laſting.</p>
            <p>Enquiring of a Goldſmith, a great Dealer in Pearl, about thoſe
which were made of the Scales of Fiſhes, he told me, that it was ſo; That
the Scales were beat to Powder, and that made into a Liquid Paſt with
Icing-glaſs, and caſt into the hollow Glaſs Beads, and ſo gave the
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour by way of foil from the inſide.</p>

it at 400 <hi>

               </hi> for that it would mix or match better with

who are nice in this particular to a fault. But I muſt take leave to tell
them, that our Salt ſpoils every thing, that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be preſerved

or the Sea Water, it is little leſs than Quicklime, and burns and reeſes
all it touches; ſo that 'tis pity to ſee ſo much good Fiſh, as is
caught upon the Northern Line of Coaſt, particularly the God and Ling and
Herring, now of little value, which were formerly the moſt eſteemed
Commodities of <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis certain there is no making good Salt by

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> ſay there are no bad Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riglio's; but there
are bad Muſhrooms. At firſt I was very ſhie of eating them; but by
degrees, and that there was ſcarce any Ragouts without them, I became
pleaſed with them, and found them very innocent. I am perſuaded the harm
that comes from eating them, is from the noxious Inſects and Vermin that feed
upon them, and creep into them; I have often found them full of ſuch Animals.
Poſſibly the Garden or forc't Muſhrooms, being that is done in Winter,
and in the Spring, may be much freer of this miſchief, at what time Inſects
are dead, or not much ſtirring, than the wild Muſhrooms of
<hi>Auguſt.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Fiſh.</note>This City is well ſerved with
<hi>Carp,</hi> of which there is an incredible quantity ſpent in the
<hi>Lent;</hi> They are not large, and <pb n="156" facs="tcp:61013:85"/>I think are the
better for it, but they are very clean of Mud, and well taſted.</p>
               <p>They have a particular way of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freſh Oyſters to Town,
which I never ſaw with us; To put them up in <hi>Straw Baskets</hi> of a
Pecke ſuppoſe, cut from the Shell, and without the Liquor; They are thus
very good for Stewing, and all other manner of Dreſſing.</p>
               <p>There is ſuch plenty of <hi>Macreuſe,</hi> a ſort of Sea
Ducks, in the Markets all <hi>Lent,</hi> that I admire where they got ſo
many; but theſe are reckoned and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as Fiſh, and therefore they
take them with great Induſtry; They have a rank fiſhy taſte, yet for want
of other Fleſh were very welcome. I remember we had at our Treat at the
King's Charge at <hi>Verſailles</hi> a <hi>Macreuſe Pye</hi> near two foot
diameter, for it was in <hi>Lent;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high Seaſoned, did go
down very well with rare Burgundy. There is a better Argument in
<hi>Leewenhoeke</hi> for Birds participating ſomething of the nature of
Fiſh, though their Blood is hot, than any the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> could
think of, and that is, that the <hi>Globuli</hi> of the Blood of Birds are
Oval, as thoſe of Fiſhes are; but this will take in all the Bird Kind;
which alſo in time thoſe Gentlemen may think fit to grant.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Fleſh.</note>As for their Fleſh, Mutton and
Beef, if they are good in their Kind, they come little ſhort of ours, I
cannot ſay they exceed them. But their Veal is not to be compared with ours,
being red and courſe; and I believe no Countrey in <hi>Europe</hi>
underſtands the Management of that ſort of Food like the
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> This was once proper to <hi>Eſſex;</hi> but now it is
well known, that nothing contributes more to the whiteneſs and tenderneſs
of the Fleſh of Calves, than <hi>often Bleeding</hi> them, and giving them
much Food of Milk and Meal, beſides ſucking the Dam. By much Bleeding the
red Cake of the Blood is exhauſted, and becomes all <hi>White Serum</hi> or
Chyle. The ſame effect Cramming hath upon Poultry, ſo as the Blood is well
near all Chyle; and the Livers of Geeſe ſo fed by force, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, for
the ſame reaſon, vaſtly great, and white and delicious.</p>
               <p>I cannot but take notice here of a great Prejudice the
<hi>French</hi> lie under, in relation to our Fleſh; 'Tis generally ſaid
amongſt them, that our Meat in <hi>England</hi> will not make ſo ſtrong
Broth, as the <hi>French,</hi> by a third part. If they ſay, not ſo ſalt
and ſavoury, and ſtrong taſted, I agree with them; and yet the
<hi>French</hi> Meat <pb n="158" facs="tcp:61013:86"/>is never the better. For firſt
their Meat is moſtly leaner and more dry, and (which is all in all in this
matter of Soupes) is long kept before it be ſpent, which gives it a higher
and ſalter taſte; for as Meat rots, it becomes more urinous and ſalt. Now
our People by cuſtom, covet the freſheſt Meat, and cannot indure the
leaſt tendency to putrefaction; and we have good reaſon to do ſo,
becauſe our Air is twice as moiſt as theirs, which does often cauſe in
the keeping of Meat a Muſtineſs, which is intolerable to all Mankind;
whereas the Air of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much drier, keeping of Meat, not
only makes it tender, but improves the taſte. So that could we ſecure our
Meat, in keeping it from that unſavoury qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it would far outdo the
<hi>French</hi> Meat, becauſe much more juicy.</p>
               <p>I don't remember I eat of above two ſorts of Fleſh, but what
we have as good or better in <hi>England,</hi> and that was of the Wild Pigs;
and the Redleg'd Partridge. Of theſe laſt I eat at <hi>St. Clou,</hi> taken
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; as to bigneſs; they are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from thoſe in
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> and leſs; but far excel the gray Partridge in
taſte.</p>

was in the worſt time of the year, from <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> to
<hi>Midſummer,</hi> ſo that we had little ſave Winter Fruits; ſome few
<hi>Bon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens</hi> we taſted, not much better than ours, but ſomething

               <p>The <hi>Kentiſh Pippin,</hi> as we call it, was here excellent;

good till after <hi>Eaſter.</hi> Alſo the <hi>Pome d'Apis,</hi> which is

beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, very red on one ſide, and pale or white on the other, and may
ſerve the Ladies at their Toilets for a Pattern to Paint by. However this
tender Apple was not contemptible after <hi>Whitſuntide;</hi> and which is
its property, it never ſmells ill, though the Ladies keep it (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               <p>I never met with any thing peculiar in their Sweet Meats, but a

               <p>The Wines of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Champagne</hi> are moſt

               <p>The moſt eſteemed are <hi>Vin de Bonne</hi> of

               <p>There is another ſort of Wine, called <hi>Vin de Rheims,</hi>
this is alſo a pale or gray Wine; it is harſh; as all <hi>Champagne</hi>

               <p>In <hi>March</hi> I taſted the White Wines called
<hi>Condrieu,</hi> and <hi>d'Arbois,</hi> but found them both in the Muſt,
thick and white as our Wines uſe to be, when they firſt come from the
<hi>Canaries;</hi> very ſweet, and yet not without a grateful flavour; they
clear towards Summer, and abate much of the flavour and ſweet taſte.
Thoſe Wines thus in the Muſt are called in the Prints <hi>Vin des

               </p>
               <p>There is a preparation or rather ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the White Wine in

                  <hi>Gannetin</hi> from <hi>Dauphine:</hi> This is a very pale and

               <p>The Red Wines of <hi>Burgundy, Des qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres feuilles,</hi> as they

wholeſom, and are permitted to the Sick, in ſome caſes, to drink of; they
are fine, and have a rough, but ſound taſte; not prickt, as I expected.
This Term <hi>Des quatre feuilles,</hi> is uſed alſo to <hi>Volne,</hi> or

<hi>Muſcat.</hi> Theſe are of thoſe ſorts <pb n="163" facs="tcp:61013:88"/>of
Wines, which the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Vinum paſſum,</hi> that were
made of half Sun dried Grapes: for the Grapes (eſpecially the White
Muſcadine Grapes) being uſually ſooner ripe, than the common Grapes of
the Country, called <hi>Eſperan, viz.</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> (as I have ſeen them in the Vintage at <hi>Vic,
Mirabel,</hi> and <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniac,</hi> 3 Towns near the Sea in
<hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> where this ſort of Wine is made) they twiſt the
Bunches of Grapes, ſo breaking the Stalks of them, that they receive no
longer any nouriſhment from the Vine, but hang down and dry in the then
violently hot Sun, and are in few days almoſt turned into Raiſins of the
Sun; hence, from this inſolation, the flavour of the Grape is exceedingly
height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the ſtrength and oilineſs, and thick Body of the Wine is
mightily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. I think the <hi>Red St. Lauren</hi> was the moſt

Brandy made with Peach and Apricock Stones, highly piquant, and of a moſt
greeable flavour.</p>
               <p>The pungent and acrimonious quality of theſe and ſuch like
Kernels was not unknown to the Ancients, and very poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous to ſome
Animals. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> tells us, a Paſt made of the Kernels of

and <hi>Spain,</hi> are wont to be brought in, at the latter end of the
<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert</hi> in all great Feaſts, and they drink freely of them; Which
Cuſtom is new: when I was formerly in <hi>France,</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nothing of
it. But it is the long War that has introduced them, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry
ſuffering much in thoſe tedious Campagnes, applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to theſe
Liquors to ſupport the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Fatigues of Weather and Watchings;
and at their return to <hi>Paris,</hi> introduced them to their Tables. Sure I
am, the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are ſtrangely altered in
their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Habit of Body; from lean and ſlender, they are
become fat and corpulent, the Women eſpecially: Which, in my Opinion, can
proceed from nothing ſo much as the daily drinking ſtrong Liquors.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Coffee, Tea, Chocolate.</note>Add to theſe
Drinks the daily uſe of Coffee with <hi>Sugar,</hi> Tea and Chocolate, which
now is as much in uſe in Private Houſes in <hi>Paris,</hi> as with us in

               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:61013:90"/>I muſt not forget, that amongſt the
Drinks that are in uſe in <hi>Paris, Cyder</hi> from <hi>Normandy</hi> is
one. The beſt I drank of that Kind, was of the colour of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, reddiſh
or brown; The Apple, that it was made of, was called <hi>Frequins,</hi> which
is round and yellow, but ſo bitter, that it is not to be eaten; and yet the
Cyder that is made of it, is as ſweet as any new Wine. It keeps many years
good, and mends of its colour and taſte. I drank it often at a Private
Houſe of a <hi>Norman</hi> Gentleman, of whoſe Growth it was; otherwiſe,
if I had not have to the contrary, I could not have believed, but that it had
been mixt with Sugar.</p>
               <p>There are alſo very many publick <hi>Coffee-houſes,</hi> where
Tea alſo and Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late may be had, and all the Strongwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Wine
above-mentioned; and innumerable <hi>Alehouſes.</hi> I wonder at the great
change of this Sober Nation, in this particular; but Luxury like a Whirlpool
draws into it the Extravagances of other People.</p>
               <p>'Twas Neceſſity, and the want of Wine, (either naturally, as
in a great part of <hi>Perſia</hi> and the <hi>Indies;</hi> or from their
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <pb n="167" facs="tcp:61013:90"/>as in <hi>Turkey,</hi>) that put Men upon the
invention of thoſe Liquors of Coffee and Tea: Chocalate, indeed, was found
out by the poor ſtarved <hi>Indians,</hi> as Ale was with us. But what elſe
but a Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Luxury could diſpoſe theſe People, who abound in Excellent
Wines, the moſt cordial and generous of all Drinks, to ape the neceſſity
of others.</p>
               <p>Mighty things, indeed, are ſaid of theſe Drinks, according to
the Humour and Fancy of the Drinkers. I rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are permitted by
Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the leſſening the number of Mankind by ſhortning
Life, as a ſort of ſilent Plague. Thoſe that plead for Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate, ſay,
it gives them a good Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, if taken two hours before Dinner. Right! who
doubts it? you ſay you are much more hungry having drunk Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate, than you
had been if you had drunk none; that is, your Stomach is faint, craving and
feels hollow and empty, and you cannot ſtay long for your Dinner. Things that
paſs thus ſoon out of the Stomach, I ſuſpect are little welcome there,
and Nature makes haſte to get ſhut of them. There are many things of this
ſort which impoſe upon us by procuring a falſe hunger.</p>

and it proves to moſt tender Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions perfect Phyſic, at leaſt to

               <p>The old <hi>Romans</hi> did better with their Luxury; they took

               <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Water</hi> which they drink at

Buildings in and about <hi>Paris,</hi> and worth going to ſee: This noble

               </p>
               <p>The River Water is very pernicious to all Strangers, not the

of <hi>Paris,</hi> cauſing Looſeneſs, and ſometimes Dyſenteries. I am
apt to think, the many <hi>Ponds</hi> and <hi>Lakes</hi> that are let into it

cauſe of it. But thoſe who are careful of themſelves purifie it by
filling their Ciſterns with Sand, and letting it ſink through it; which way
clears it, and makes it very cool and palatable.</p>
               <p>As for the Spring Water from the <hi>Maiſon des Eaux,</hi> it is

give the Stone, which the People of this Town are infinitely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to. An
Inſtance of this I had by chance, when coming from ſeeing the <hi>Aqueduct
of Arcueil,</hi> in the very Road near the Wall of the <hi>Aqueduct,</hi> a
great number of Earthen Pipes, which had ſerved to convey that Water to
ſome Houſe, were caſt to mend the High-ways. I obſerved, that of 4
inches diameter the <pb n="170" facs="tcp:61013:92"/>hollow of the Pipes were all ſtopt
up to the breadth of a Shilling, with a firm Stone petrified; ſo that they
were forc'd to break up the Pipes being altogether uſeleſs. Now what

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Opera's.</note>I did not ſee many Opera's,
not being ſo good a French-Man as to underſtand them, when Sung: The Opera,
called <hi>l'Europe Gallante,</hi> I was at ſeveral times, and it is lookt
upon as one of the very beſt. It is extreamly fine, and the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and
Singing admirable: The Stage large and magnificent, and well filled with
Actors: The Scenes well ſuited to the thing, and as quick in the removal of
them, as can be thought. The Dancing exquiſite, as being performed by the
beſt <hi>Maſters</hi> of that Profeſſion in Town: The 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61013:92"/>Cloathing rich, proper, and with great variety.</p>
               <p>It is to be wondered, that theſe Opera's are ſo frequented:
There are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Nobility that come daily to them, and ſome
that can Sing them all: And it was one thing that was trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to us
Strangers, to diſturb the Box by theſe voluntary Songs of ſome parts of
the Opera or other; That the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may be ſaid to be here as much
Actors as thoſe imployed upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Stage.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Comedies.</note>The <hi>Comedies</hi> have
another Houſe in another part of the Town; for the Opera's are under the Roof
of Monſieur, and it is part of the <hi>Palais Royal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Diſpoſition of the Theatre is much the ſame; but
ſomething leſs: And here the Stage it ſelf is to be Let; where for
<hi>Strangers,</hi> the Places are moſt commodious, to hear and ſee.</p>
               <p>I heard many <hi>Tragedies,</hi> but without guſt for want of
Language: But after them, the <hi>Little Plays</hi> were very Divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me,
particularly thoſe of <hi>Moliere, Vendange de Sureſne, Pourcegnac,
Criſpin Medecin, le Medecin malgre luy, le Malade Imaginaire,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:61013:93"/>In this all agree, that tho'
<hi>Moliere</hi>'s Plays have <hi>leſs of Intrigue</hi> in them; yet his
<hi>Characters</hi> of Perſons are incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo true and juſt, that
nothing can be more: And for this Reaſon, ſo many of them are only of two
or three Acts; for without an Intrigue well laid, the Characters would have
failed him, in which was his Excellency. However, this is now ſo much become
a Cuſtom on the French Stage; that you ever have one of theſe little Pieces
tack'd to the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that you may pleaſe your ſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your
Appetite.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid, <hi>Moliere</hi> Died ſuddenly in Acting the
<hi>Malade Imaginaire:</hi> Which is a good inſtance of his well
Perſonating the Play he made, and how he could really put himſelf into any
Paſſion he had in his Head. Alſo of the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtrong and
vehement Paſſions may cauſe in weak Conſtitutions, ſuch as Joy and
Fear; which Hiſtory tells us, have killed many very ſuddenly. He is
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have ſaid, going off the Stage, <hi>Meſſieurs, Jay joue le
Malade Imaginaire; Mais je ſuis veritablement fort Malade;</hi> and he died
within two hours after. This Account of <hi>Moliere</hi> is not in his Life by
<hi>Perault,</hi> but it is true: And he yet has blamed him for his Folly, in
perſecuting <pb n="173" facs="tcp:61013:93"/>the Art of Phyſick, not the Men, in
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Plays.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moliere</hi> ſent for Dr. <hi>M—,</hi> a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
in <hi>Paris</hi> of great Eſteem and Worth, and now in <hi>London,</hi> a
Refuge. Dr. <hi>M—</hi> ſent him word, he would come to him, upon two
Conditions; the one, that he ſhould Anſwer him only to ſuch Queſtions
as he ſhould ask him, and not otherwiſe Diſcourſe him; the other, that
he ſhould oblige himſelf to take the Medecines he ſhould preſcribe for
him. But <hi>Moliere</hi> finding the Doctor too hard for him, and not eaſily
to be <hi>Dupt,</hi> refuſed them. His Buſineſs, it ſeems, was to make
a Comical Scene in expoſing one of the Learnedeſt Men of the
Profeſſion, as he had done the Quacks. If this was his Intention, as in all
probability it was, <hi>Moliere</hi> had as much Malice, as Wit; which is only
to be uſed to correct the Vitiouſneſs and Folly of Men pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
Knowledge, and not the Arts themſelves.</p>
               <p>This I muſt needs ſay, That Obſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Immorality are
not at all upon the French Stage, no more than in the Civil Converſation of
People of Faſhion and good Breeding.</p>

Afternoon in <hi>Lent,</hi> I was to hear a <hi>Sermon</hi> at <hi>La

about the Angels Deſcent into the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> and Troubling
the Waters. I am not ſo good a French-Man as to underſtand all he ſaid,
but he had many good Arguments about the neceſſity of Grace, and the means
to attain it. I was ſtrangely ſurpriſed at the Vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Action,
which to me appeared altogether Comical, and like the Actors upon the Stage,
which I had ſeen a few days before: Beſides, his Expreſſions ſeemed
to be in too Familiar a Style: I always took a Sermon to the People to require
a grave and ornate kind of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and not <hi>Verba Quotidiana,</hi> with
a certain dignity of Action; but 'tis poſſible this way here beſt ſuits

Fortune in a manner is all in all, are great Temptations to Ruine, by the

               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:61013:95"/>The Building is a very Barn, or Frame of

makes it very uneaſie to Walk in, were it not the vaſt croud of People

               <p>The great Rendezvous is at night, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Play and Opera are

whether he did not fear Cudgelling in the end: He anſwered with a ſingular
Confidence, that it was the Painter's fault; that he had given the Racoun to
Paint to two Maſters, but both had miſtaken the Beaſt; but however, (he

Theſe eight lines of Coaches, may, when full, ſuppoſing them to contain

                  <hi>D'Aumont.</hi> Its <hi>Green Houſe</hi> opened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
Dining Room: The Orange Trees ſeemed to have ſuffered, and had their Leaves
withered; for the Room was too broad by half.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Treillage,</hi> at the upper end of the Garden, was very
well adorned with Gilding, and had in the middle a Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61013:100"/>in which was an old <hi>Roman</hi> Statue of a young Man,
very well preſerved: The faſhion of the <hi>Toga</hi> here was ſo
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it might well paſs for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to thoſe, who have
thought it to be a Plade, or a Garment open before like a Cloak.</p>
               <p>This Treillage is performed with that variety of Ornaments, that
it reſembles Filegreen Work, and is large. The Painting of theſe Works in
green is not well performed in all places alike; it is either too yellow, or of
a ſad dirty green, or Sea green; few have hit the right Graſs green colour.
To do it well, it is to be primed in yellow, and then to be covered with
<hi>Vert de Montagne</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Armeniacus;</hi> of which laſt colour
we have plenty in <hi>England</hi> about <hi>Maulham</hi> in <hi>Craven</hi> in
<hi>Yorkeſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the great benefit of Treillage in Cities, that beſides
the beauty of it to the Eye, it takes away and hides the ill proſpect of the
Neighbouring Houſes.</p>
               <p>Here were very many <hi>Fig-Trees</hi> well grown in ſquare
Boxes; and Parterrs well ſtockt with Flowers; each ſort by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;

                  <hi>Puiſſart.</hi> This Garden is very
neat, and open at the end to the <hi>Tuilleries.</hi> The <hi>Treillage</hi>
Walk or Arbor at the upper end is very fine, 70 Paces long, and 8 broad, hath 3
Pavillons all open at the top. It is all of Iron, painted green, and coſt
15000 Livers.</p>
               <p>The Gardner was an Artiſt; and had ſome Plants in Caſes in
good order, not to be ſeen elſewhere, as large Roſemary Buſhes,
Jacobaea Maritima, Marum Syriacum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Walls were well covered with Fruit Trees; he had not cut his
Peaches; when I askt him the reaſon, he told me, it was his way, not to cut
them till after flowring, which he found by Experience to improve the Fruit;
whereas he ſaid, the early cutting Stockt them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the Fruit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Orangery</hi> here was the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Room, for the

from the top to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, after our <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner. I make no

               <p>
                  <hi>Bouvillier.</hi> I found not any thing more remarkable here
than the Trellage at the end.</p>

                  <hi>Comartin.</hi> The Trellage in this
Garden was moſt admirable in the faſhion of a Triumphal Arch; half of it
was an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viarie,</hi> with a Fountain in it, well ſtor'd with Birds.</p>
               <p>Here were large Iron <hi>Vaſa</hi>'s upon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtals, the
firſt I had ſeen of the Kind, painted over of a Copper colour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Les Diguieres.</hi> This is the only Houſe in
<hi>Paris,</hi> I ſaw kept in all the parts of it, with the moſt exact
cleanlineſs and neatneſs, Gardens and all.</p>
               <p>In the Garden there were ſeveral pieces of Trellage; that at the
upper end was very noble, and coſt 10000 Livres; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other piece of it coſt
6000. But I ſaw a ſmall one all of Iron-leaves painted green, the only one
of the Kind. Here alſo were <hi>great Vaſa's of Trelliage</hi> upon
Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals.</p>
               <p>The Fountains in this Garden were very curious, though ſmall,
with proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, which had a marvellous effect, when the Spouts plaied
off.</p>
               <p>The firſt Court was ſet about with Caſes of extraordinary
large <hi>Laurus Tinus,</hi> and in the Gardens there were ſome cut into
ſquare Pyramids.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:61013:101"/>A Perſon of Quality came into the Garden
to me, who with great Civility conducted me up to the Apartments.</p>
               <p>In the Apartment of the Dutcheſs, which was all of her own
Contrivance, and had an Air of State and Agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beyond any thing I
had ſeen, I obſerved hanging down in the middle of the Bed-chamber the
fineſt Cryſtal Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick in <hi>France:</hi> The Pieces were all
bought ſingle by her, and the Contrivance and ſetting them together was her
own; it coſt 12000 Crowns.</p>
               <p>But before I left the Garden, in an obſcure Parterre I ſaw the
Tomb of a Cat, <hi>viz.</hi> a Black Cat Couchant upon a White Marble
Cuſhion, fringed with Gold, and Gold Taſſels hanging at the corners upon
a ſquare Black Marble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal: On one of the ſides of that Marble is
writ in Letters of Gold.

               <p>
                  <hi>De Lorge.</hi> We had the good fortune here to find the
Marſhal himſelf walking in his Garden; who Entertained us with great
Civility, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dean of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> and my ſelf. This
Garden was not finiſht, and the Houſe it ſelf was but building; but it is
one of the fineſt in <hi>Paris,</hi> and has the advantage of a moſt free
and extended proſpect of the Fields and <hi>Montmarter:</hi> At the end of
the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den riſes a Tarraſs equal with the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
               <p>That which was in this Houſe and Garden very commodious and
noble was, that betwixt the two Courts the Coaches drive through a ſtately
Hall upon Pillars, and might land on either ſide, up a ſtep 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61013:102"/>or two, which leads to the Staircaſes and other
Apartments; and then in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Court, which is only divided from the
Garden by high Pallaſadoes of Iron, they turn, and take up the Company
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; ſo that no Weather offends them. Which is much wanting here; and more
with us at <hi>London,</hi> where we moſt need it.</p>
               <p>This Hall is open upon Arches to the Garden, and the Staircaſe
it ſelf is ſo contrived, that you enjoy a full proſpect of the Garden and
<hi>Montmarter</hi> in deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal very obligingly ſhewed us his own Apartment; for
all the reſt of the Houſe was full of Workmen; and in his Bedchamber his
little <hi>Red Damask Field Bed,</hi> which he lay in now, and which alſo
ſerved him, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded upon the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſhewed us his great <hi>Saſh Windows;</hi> how eaſily
they might be lifted up and down, and ſtood at any height; which Contrivance
he ſaid he had out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by a ſmall Model brought on
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe from thence: There being nothing of this <hi>Poiſe</hi> in Windows

               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:61013:103"/>He alſo had us into a Set of ſmall
Cloſets or Rooms, after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, very prettily
furniſhed, neatly kept, and retired, with his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Keys to
them, as he told us; and from thence we deſcended a back Pair of Stairs: We
did all we could to hinder him from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us take Coach: He ſent his Page
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, to invite us ſome day to Eat with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hoſtel Pelitier.</hi> The Garden here was very neat, with a
Trelliage at the end after the manner of a Triumphal Arch, but not very high,
nor well Painted; yet its Beauty and Finiſhings differ much from any I had
ſeen before. In the two Niches were plac'd great Iron Vaſa's or Flower
Pots, right before the middle of a Baſin of Water, which was ſet a Playing
for our Entertainment, which is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment the French are willing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
Strangers with.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Orangerie</hi> were very large Trees, and two pair of
Mirtles in Caſes, cut Globe-wiſe, the beſt and biggeſt I had ſeen:
Large Buſhes in Pots of <hi>Marum Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacum.</hi> Great ſtore of Tulips,

Earthen Pots, as with us; but in very light Mold. Great and very fair
<hi>Laurus Tinus's</hi> in Caſes. And, which was ſingular, a-long one of
the Garden Walls were planted <hi>Abel Trees,</hi> whoſe tops were
diſpoſed and ſpread by an Iron Trelliage into Arches at equal

Antique, rarely good. One of the firſt Empreſſes, a <hi>Diana,</hi> an

to let them down or run them up to what height they pleaſe. This way may very

of my way and humour to go to Court; but becauſe it was my fortune to be at

               <p>This Diſtrict may be ſaid to be <hi>Le Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceau des Roys,</hi>
or the Nurſery of Kings; for the chief of the Blood Royal are lodged here,
<hi>viz.</hi> the King, Monſeigneur the Dauphin, and the 3 Grandſons, the

are well Husbanded, and cut into ſmall and bigger Alleys, to ſave 
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61013:105"/>the Trees; which they have had ſo great a care of, they
have kept them ſtanding not only in the Alleys, but in the very <hi>Steps of
Stone,</hi> which are made to deſcend into the Alleys.</p>
               <p>In the other parts of the Garden the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys are moſtly treble,
and well ſhaded, run out in vaſt lengths of ſeveral miles, every where
<hi>Baſins and Jetts d'eau;</hi> but there is a <hi>Caſcade,</hi> which I
ſaw ſeveral times play, and is ſaid to be the moſt beautiful and beſt
furniſht with Water of any in <hi>France.</hi> In the middle of the large
Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin amongſt the Woods, I ſaw a <hi>Jet d'eau,</hi> which threw up a
Spout of Water 90 foot high, and did diſcharge it ſelf with that force,
that it made a miſt and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Air a great compaſs round about,
and gave now and then cracks like the going off of a Piſtol; ſuch force the
vent of Wind in the Pipes had.</p>
               <p>The Pipes which convey the Water are compoſed of Iron Cylinders
3 foot long, ſome 10, ſome 20 inches diameter, till they divide; and then
they are of Lead.</p>
               <p>I was once kindly invited to <hi>St. Clou</hi> by Madam's
Phyſician, Monſieur <hi>Arlot,</hi> who ſent his Coach for me to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and nobly Treated me: Before Dinner he carried me in his Coach
(for this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <pb n="198" facs="tcp:61013:106"/>is granted him) into all parts, and
round the Gardens; which were well furniſht with Alleys and Walks, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Cypreſs, Pines, and Firrs, cut into Pyramids; and Water-Works every
where playing in abundance, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Gerbes d'eau</hi> were very
fine, that is, great and thick, ſeeming Streams of Water thrown up into the
Air; This is done to husband the Water by a great number of ſmall Pipes like
a <hi>Sheaf,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a ſolid Pillar of Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur</hi> has added, and taken into this vaſt Garden,
a new acquiſition of a <hi>Mountainous Plain,</hi> which over-looks all the
Country round; and will, no doubt, when it is modelled by that admirable
Contriver <hi>Monſ. le Noſtre,</hi> make one of the moſt delightful
Places in the World.</p>
               <p>From the Baluſtrade in the Upper Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the River
<hi>Seine,</hi> and a vaſt Plain bounded by <hi>Paris,</hi> is to be ſeen,
and makes a moſt delightful Proſpect.</p>
               <p>Theſe vaſt <hi>riding Gardens</hi> are unknown to us in
<hi>England,</hi> and <hi>ſe promener a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, on en caroſſe,</hi> is
not <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford to loſe ſo much Country, as
thoſe Gardens take up. I ſee in ſome of the Quarters not only Partridge
and Hares plentifully, but, which I wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, 5 <hi>Biches</hi> or Female
Red-Deer feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:61013:106"/>The <hi>Orangery</hi> belonging to this
Garden is very large and magnificent, paved with Marble, and was filled with
vaſt Trees in Caſes, not to be brought in or out without proper Engines,
but in it there was nothing but thoſe Orange Trees, Oleanders, and Laurus
Tinus's. He goes out of the end of his Appartment, that is, the noble painted
Gallery is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued upon a level with the Orangery, which leads directly into
an aſcending Walk of a vaſt length; and alſo fronts or flanks all along
the Parterre or Flower Garden; where they are diſpoſed of in Summer. At
this Treat I eat of a Preſerve or Wet Sweetmeat, made of Orange Flowers,
incomparable; and the Lady obliged me with the manner of making it.</p>
               <p>Though there were high and proper Walls for Fruit in many parts of
the Garden, yet nothing of that nature was to be found, only ordinary and
<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructiferous Greens</hi> were faſtned to the Treillage, which are the
Linings of moſt Walls here. In the Garden are many Arbours of Treillage,
Pavillons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Iron mixt with Wood, painted Green, with Honey
Suckles running up them. Theſe Gardens have above 150 People always imployed
to keep them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <pb n="200" facs="tcp:61013:107"/>which ſtands in 40000 Livres a
year.</p>
               <p>Another time I Dined with the Captain of the Caſtle, who
ſhewed me all the Apartments at leiſure. I eat here of the Red Leg'd
Partridge taken here upon theſe Hills; They are much leſs here than in
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> but yet far better taſted, than the Grey Partridges taken
in the ſame place. This was the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and we drank our
Wine in Ice, which I was not aware off, till I found the bad effect of it in my
Throat; and the next day much more; but it went off again without any great
trouble. There is no Animal that abuſes it ſelf in Meat and Drink, as Man
does; we daily drink exceſſive hot and exceſſive cold; in other
Creatures it's Inſtinct that guides them, but as for us we neither act by
Inſtinct, nor Reaſon; but betwixt both <hi>looſely,</hi> and therefore
oftner are catcht, to our own deſtruction.</p>
               <p>At the end of the Apartments of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> are a fine
Set of Cloſets; The firſt you enter is furniſht with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of
Rock Cryſtals, Cups, Agats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſmall Stands, and the ſides of the Rooms
are lined with large Panes of Looking-glaſs from top to the bottom, with
Japan Varniſh and Paintings of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual <pb n="201" facs="tcp:61013:107"/>breadth
intermixt; which had a marvellous pretty effect. The other Room had in it a
vaſt quantity of <hi>Bijou,</hi> and many of very great Price; but the
<hi>Siam Pagods,</hi> and other things from thence, were very odd.</p>
               <p>There was alſo one very ſmall <hi>Roman Statue</hi> of White
Marble, not 10 inches high, which coſt 20000 Crowns; one Leg of it was a
little injured. It ſeemed a Piece of admirable Workmanſhip. It was a
<hi>Boy,</hi> who had in the Skirt of his Tunic <hi>a Litter of Puppies,</hi>
and the <hi>Bitch</hi> lying at his feet and looking up.</p>

                  </note>As to the Palace
of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> (which is yet ſome miles further within the
Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Country, not unlike <hi>Black-Heath</hi> 
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:61013:108"/>or
<hi>Tunbridge</hi>) 'tis without diſpute the moſt magnificent of any in
<hi>Europe;</hi> Yet what of it was firſt built, and much admired 30 years
ago, is now no longer reliſht: However this King intends to rebuild it, where
it is faulty. 'Tis, as I ſaid, plac'd in a very ungrateful Soil, without
Earth proper for Herbs, or Water; but he hath brought that to it in abundance,
and made the Ground too to be fruitful.</p>
               <p>There are Books writ to deſcribe this famous Palace in every
part; to which I refer the Reader. The Way to it is new, and in ſome places
the Mountains are cut down 40 foot, ſo that now you enjoy it a mile in
proſpect before you come to it; it opens and cloſes in 3 Courts, the more
remoteſt narrower and narrower; which is a fault; and is, as I was told,
deſigned to be pulled down, and made into one noble large ſquare Court of
the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of building, as that magnificent Front is, which looks upon
the Gardens. The Gilded Tiles and Roof have a marvellous effect in proſpect.
The Splanade towards the Gardens and Parterres are the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt things that
can be ſeen, vaſtly great, with a very large Baſin of Water in the
middle, walled round with white Marble, on which are placed a great number of
incomparable Brazen Vaſa, and large <pb n="203" facs="tcp:61013:108"/>Braſs Figures
<hi>couchant,</hi> of the beſt Maſters in Sculpture; it were endleſs to
tell all the Furniture of theſe Gardens of Marble Statues, and Vaſa of
Braſs and Marble, the multitude of Fountains, and thoſe wide Canals like
Seas running in a ſtreight line from the bottom of the Gardens, as far as the
Eye can reach.</p>
               <p>In a Word, theſe Gardens are a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey laid out into Alleys
and Walks, Groves of Trees, Canals and Fountains, and every where adorned with
ancient and modern Statues and <hi>Vaſa</hi> innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 17th the Waters were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Play for the

Water, thrown up into the Air, is here diverſified after a thouſand
faſhions. The <hi>Theatre des eaux,</hi> and the <hi>Triumphal Arch</hi> are
the moſt famous Pieces. But in the Groves of the Left Hand, you have
<hi>Aeſop's Fables,</hi> in ſo many Pieces of Water-Works, here and there
in Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Alleys. This might have been ſaid to be done <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſum

Conſervato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for Tubs of Winter Greens, is what correſponds to the
greatneſs of the reſt. 'Tis a ſtupendious <hi>half ſquare</hi> of
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground Vaults, like the Naves of ſo many Churches put together, of
exquiſite Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip in hewn Stone, well lighted and open to the South
Sun. It contains 3000 Caſes of Greens; whereof near 2000 are Orange Trees,
and many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of them are as big as generally they naturally grow in the
Earth: Hence amongſt them are ſome, which are ſaid to be in Caſes from
the time of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt.</p>
               <p>They did not think fitting to put them out this year till the

                     <hi>Marli.</hi>
                  </note>The 15th of <hi>May</hi>
my Lord Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor went to <hi>Marli,</hi> where the Waters played for his
Diverſion.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs ſay it is one of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt Places I
ever ſaw, or, I believe, is in <hi>Europe;</hi> it is ſeated in the boſom
or upper end of a high Valley, in the midſt of and ſurrounded with Woody
Hills. The Valley is cloſed at the upper end, and gently deſcends forwards
by degrees, and opens wider and wider, and gives you the proſpect of a vaſt
plain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the River <hi>Seine</hi> running through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marli</hi> is a ſquare Houſe raiſed upon Steps, and
Terraſſed on all ſides; The 4 Fronts all alike; and the Doors opening
into the Garden all the ſame. In the middle <hi>an Octogon-hall,</hi> running
up Dome-wiſe, in which all the ſide Rooms meet; which are all Rooms of
State. Above are 12 Lodgings, with a narrow Gallery leading to them. In the
lower Rooms at <hi>Marli,</hi> particularly in the <hi>Octogon Salan,</hi> are
extraordinary large (6 foot at leaſt) Marble, or rather <hi>Agat Tables;</hi>
To the beſt of which they may be compared. They are veined like Wood, and of
an Amber colour; Theſe are the admirable effect of Petrification. Of this
very <pb n="206" facs="tcp:61013:110"/>Stone I have ſeen great Blocks in the Banks of the
<hi>Dropping Well</hi> at <hi>Knaresbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> in <hi>Yorkeſhire.</hi> I
forgot to ask here whence they had them.</p>
               <p>In one of the Ground Rooms was a Semicircular <hi>Gilt Bar</hi> or
Rail, which took off and incloſed the upper end of the Room: Within the Bar
was diſpoſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rows of Porcellain or fine China on Gilt Shelves.
Here at the Corners, within the Bar, opened two ſmall Doors, whence the
Ambaſſador and his Retinue were plentifully ſerved with Chocolate, Tea,
and Coffee, in a moſt obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; Many of the Nobility and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>France</hi> were ordered to attend him there.</p>
               <p>The two ſide Fronts of the Houſe have in proſpect great
Alleys cut through the Woods, and paved for the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious coming down to
the Houſe; which is deſcending all the way.</p>
               <p>On each ſide the Valley, cloſe under the Woods, run along in a
line, ſix ſquare Pavillons or ſmaller Palaces of the very ſame figure
and beauty with the <hi>Mother Houſe;</hi> at equal, but large diſtances,
as 500 Paces. The 6 on the right hand the Garden are for the Men; The other 6
on the left are for the Women of Quality; whom the King weekly appoints, upon 
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61013:110"/>a Liſt given, to attend him, and enjoy the Pleaſure
of this Retirement, as I may ſay, from Court. Before thoſe Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and
betwixt them, are the fineſt Alleys and Walks imaginable, with Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and all the Decorations of Treil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and Flowers. Such a ſhew of <hi>not
ordinary Tulips</hi> in broad Beds, of a 1000 Paces long, every where, all this
vaſt Garden over, in their full beauty, was a moſt ſurpriſing ſight.
I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſay to the Duke <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who was
pleaſed much to accompany me in this Walk, That ſure all the Gardens in
<hi>France</hi> had contributed to this Profuſion of Flowers; which he took
ſo well, that the <hi>Mariſhal his Father;</hi> afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached
himſelf to ſingle me out, and very obligingly embraced me, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
me with a Kiſs, and followed it with very kind and familiar
Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſcade</hi> coming down from the brow of the Hill, on
that Front of the Houſe which reſpects and ſtands near it, was new and
ſingular, and of the Kings own invention, as, indeed, all the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
beſides. From the Houſe it appeared a <hi>Broad River,</hi> quietly gliding
down the Hill; but when I went near it, I found it compoſed of 52 large
ſquare and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Baſins of Water, diſpoſed at right 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61013:111"/>Angles, and not declining, but falling over one into
another.</p>
               <p>In the Garden were many Fountains, nobly adorned, and had variety
of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Pipes playing up into the Air in them. Here are ſome
<hi>Gerbes</hi> of a ſingular faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with a Circle of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of
large Pipes, within at leaſt two foot diameter; which made the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of
a vaſt Pillar of Water. There was one <hi>Jet d'eau</hi> in the bottom of the
Garden, which we were told threw up Water 120 foot high; for of 50 and more
Fountains, we ſaw but thoſe on the ſide Alleys to play; moſt of the
great Baſins in the middle were mending, and dry. To furniſh all this
Water, there is a moſt ſtupendious <hi>Machine,</hi> which was invented by
2 <hi>Liegois.</hi> This Machine forces the Water up 560 foot, from the River
<hi>Seine,</hi> to the top of the Tower or Aqueduct. It throws up 500 inches of
Water by almoſt continued Ructations, or quick Pulſes. It is wrought by 14
Wheels of 32 feet diameter each, ſet in the River, and carried about night
and day by its Stream.</p>
               <p>This Invention is the ſame with what is practiſed in the deep
Coal-pits about <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Lower-Germany;</hi> ſo that to ſee
the Engines, and a great number of Iron <pb n="209" facs="tcp:61013:111"/>Cylinders or
Water Pipes, lying bare <hi>above ground,</hi> and running up a vaſt
Mountain, is to imagine a deep Coal-Mine turned wrongſide outward.</p>
               <p>The Tree moſt in uſe here, was the ſmall leaved
<hi>Horne-Beam;</hi> which ſerves for <hi>Arcades, Berceaus;</hi> and alſo
<hi>Standards</hi> with Globular Heads: At the foot of which they have planted
little <hi>Sprigs</hi> of the ſame of a foot and half high; and alſo in
ſome places in like manner, whole <hi>areas</hi> full of them; which cut
ſmooth and level, make the fineſt <hi>green Hedges</hi> I ever ſaw; Some
of theſe low Hedges were 12 foot broad, and in a barren and dry Climate
ſupply very artificially the uſe of <hi>Graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis certainly very commendable in the King, who pleaſes
himſelf in Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Pruning the Trees with his own Hand, to make uſe
of no other Trees, but what the Neighbouring Woods afford; ſo that 'tis
admirable to ſee whole Alleys of <hi>Pole Hedges</hi> of great height, and
long Rows of goodly Standard Globes of 18 months growth only.</p>
               <p>If this great King, as he grows older, ſhould take a fancy to
place himſelf in a <hi>warmer Climate,</hi> (and he has a good one of his
own, as any under the Sun, in <hi>Languedoc</hi>) as he does his Winter Greens 
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61013:112"/>in proper Houſes; (and, me-thinks, this Inſtance
alone ſhould be ſufficient, to convince him of the neceſſity there is
to cheriſh decaying Nature, and that a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally warm Air is a better fence,
than Cloaths or Fire) what Wonders would not his Purſe and Paſſion for
Planting do there?</p>
               <p>The next Woods in <hi>Languedoc</hi> would afford <hi>Laurel,</hi>
and <hi>Myrtles</hi> for Pole Hedges; <hi>Lentiſcus's</hi> and
<hi>Phylarea's</hi> in as great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as Hazel or Thorn with us. Alſo
<hi>Jaſmins</hi> for Arbors and <hi>Treillage; Ciſtus's</hi> and
<hi>Roſmary,</hi> and a hundred other ſweet ſmelling Woody Shrubs grow
every where in the Fields, to furniſh the <hi>Pots</hi> and
<hi>Vaſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There the tall <hi>Cypres's</hi> grow of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to 60 and
100 foot high, like ſo many Towers; and alſo <hi>Tonſil</hi> at
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for the moſt beautiful Pole Hedges imaginable. The very Fields
are moſt Excellent, and well furniſht Parterrs of Flowers, and are
Naturally Pottageries, or Kitchin Gardens. The Vineyards are very Orchards; and
all the moſt tender Fruits with us are there <hi>Standards;</hi> as Figs, and
Grapes of all ſorts, Apricocks, Peaches, Nectorins, Jujubs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and large Cherries; and, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been ſaid to the
contrary, Pipins <pb n="211" facs="tcp:61013:112"/>and Pears there are in far greater
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, than with us, or in any parts of <hi>France</hi> elſe, beſides
that happy Climate.</p>
               <p>What was it for ſo great a King to make a Walk from
<hi>Marli</hi> to <hi>Montpelier,</hi> or (if I might chooſe) to
<hi>Peſcenas,</hi> ſeated in the boſom of a well Watered Valley,
incloſed with <hi>perfumed Hills.</hi> 'Tis not half ſo far as betwixt
<hi>Lahor</hi> and <hi>Agria,</hi> two Seats the <hi>Mogul</hi> has thus
joined. This would Eterniſe his Name, above any Palace he has yet built, and
bring to himſelf much Health in his old Age. The Gardens of the
<hi>Heſperides,</hi> and the <hi>Labyrinths of Cande,</hi> ſo famous in
Hiſtory, would be nothing to ſuch wonderful Performances, as his Abilities
and Happy Genius is capable of. For beſides the Natural Product of the
Countrey, the Climate alſo is capable of producing, and nouriſhing with
ſmall Art and Expence, what ever Plants both the <hi>Indies</hi> can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.
Whereas, at this end of the World, we drudge in vain; and force a Pleaſure
which is dead, and gone before we can well enjoy it: We have indeed a kind of
ſhew of the Summer Delights, but all on a ſuddain we drop into a long and
tedious Winter again. But we love the Places we are uſed to, or born in. Man,
to ſay the truth, is a very Animal, <pb n="212" facs="tcp:61013:113"/>as any Quadrupede
of them all; and moſt of his Actions are reſolvable into Inſtinct,
notwithſtanding the Principles which Cuſtom and Education have
ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced.</p>
               <p>The pleaſure of ſeeing is ſcarce to be tired; but yet after
2 or 3 hours Walk in ſo fine and great a Garden, I was forc't to make a halt
behind the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and glad to retire to the gilt <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau</hi> in the
Palace again, to refreſh my ſelf; where I found ſome of the Kings
Officers waiting, and ſome other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Houſhold, who had made
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Campagnes in <hi>Flanders.</hi> I had now more a mind to a Glaſs
of cool <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> than the inſignificant <hi>Indian</hi> Liquors;
which though I knew was againſt the ſanctity of the place, yet nothing was
denied me a Stranger. Here being alone, we fell into Diſcourſe of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and of their King. They willingly allowed the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to be truly Brave; and now in Peace they found alſo, that
they were as Civil, and well Bred, as Brave; That no Nation had given the King
and his Court that ſatisfaction, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had done; being
curious and inquiſitive after all good things; They did ſee a great
difference betwixt them and other Nations; They did not ſtare, and
care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesſly <pb n="213" facs="tcp:61013:113"/>run about, or hold up their Heads, and
deſpiſe what they ſaw; but had a true reliſh of every good thing, and
made a good Judgment of what was Commendable; and therefore the King took
pleaſure to have them ſhewed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing. This Diſcourſe of the
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> they concluded with a great Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium of K.
<hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for their own King they were much in the Praiſe of him, as
one may eaſily imagine: That his Retirement hither was moſtly for his
Health; That he left <hi>Verſailles</hi> every <hi>Tueſday</hi> night, and
came hither with a ſelect Company of Lords and Ladies; That he returned not
till <hi>Saturday</hi> night, and ſometimes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted 10 or 14 days; ſo
that he ſpent half of his time here in Repoſe; That he was the moſt
affable Prince in the World, and never out of Humour, of a pleaſant and open
Converſation where it pleaſed him; eaſie of acceſs, and never ſent
any one away diſcontented; The moſt Bountiful Maſter in the World, of
which there were Ten thouſand Inſtances; nothing of Merit in any Kind, but
he moſt readily and chearfully Rewarded, ever, of late years at leaſt,
preferring the Virtuous; ſo on the other hand, he never ſpared the
Rebellious and Obſtinate; That the <pb n="214" facs="tcp:61013:114"/>Government of his
People could not be carried on with leſs ſeverity and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nor
the Taxes which was neceſſary to ſupport it, raiſed; That he delighted
not in Blood or Perſecution; but that the Art of Government had different
Rules, according to the Climate and Nature of the People, where and upon whom
it was to be put in practice. His great <hi>Wiſdom</hi> appeared in nothing
more, than in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving himſelf amidſt his Troops, his Converts, his
Court and numerous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, all in a manner fit for the Throne. The greatneſs
of his Mind, and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, in his Buildings. This was the Sum of the
Diſcourſe theſe Gentlemen were pleaſed to entertain me with.</p>

                  </note>At my return to
<hi>Paris</hi> I was to ſee the <hi>Pipinerie,</hi> or <hi>Royal Nurſery of
Plants,</hi> in the <hi>Fauxbourgh</hi> of <hi>St. Honorie;</hi> where I met
the Maſter or Controuler of it, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Morley,</hi> one of the
Uſhers of the Bed-Chamber to the King.</p>
               <p>He, like the reſt of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, was Civil to
me; and ſhewed me a Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Almanack of Flowring Plants for the whole year,
which he ſaid was an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; it might, indeed, be ſo in <hi>French,</hi>
but we have had Almanacks for Fruit and Flowers, for every month in the 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61013:114"/>year, Printed divers times, for above this 30 years,
thanks to Mr. <hi>Evelyn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Ground incloſed with high Walls is vaſtly big, as it
ought to be, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Kings Gardens; Here are ſeveral Acres of young
Pines, Cypreſſes, Vues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo vaſt Beds of Stock
July-Flowers, of all ſorts of Bulbes, as Tulips, Dafi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dills, Crocus's,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore I could eaſily believe him, when he told me,
he had ſent from hence to <hi>Marli</hi> alone, in 4 years time, 18 millions
of Tulips, and other Bulbous Flowers; for which he offered to ſhew me his
Memoires.</p>
               <p>He further told me, that the furniſhing the <hi>Trianon,</hi> (a
peculiar Houſe of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with its Parterres at the end of the Gardens
at <hi>Verſailles</hi>) with Flower Pots in ſeaſon, every 14 days in the
Summer, took up no leſs than 92000 Pots from hence.</p>
               <p>Alſo from hence he could Plant and furniſh in 14 days time,
any new Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the King ſhould cauſe to be made.</p>
               <p>Here beſides the Plants common to us and them, I ſaw a
multitude of Pots well conditioned of <hi>Staechas citrina folio
latiuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo a ſort of <hi>Cotila,</hi> which bore large Sun Flowers
or Marigolds, propagated by Slips, called by him <hi>Amaroutre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:61013:115"/>In this Ground are ſeveral Houſes to
lodge the tender Winter Greens; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt there is one very large,
which I may call the <hi>Infirmery of ſick Orange Trees;</hi> which coming
from <hi>Genoa</hi> by Sea, are here depoſited in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Green Houſe;
and there were in it, and then actually carrying out into the Air, (it was the
22th of <hi>May</hi> our Style) 300 Trees in Caſes as thick as a Man's Thigh;
but after 10, and ſome after 17 years cheriſhing, had not yet got Heads
decent enough to be removed, and to appear at Court, they being often forc't to
lop both Tops and Root, that they might recover them.</p>
               <p>After all, it muſt be ſaid, that this Magnificence, and the
number of theſe Palaces and Gardens, are the beſt and moſt commendable
effect of <hi>Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> If theſe Expences were not in time
of Peace, what would be this Kings Riches, and the extream Poverty of the
People? For it is ſaid, that every 3 years, ſome ſay much oftner, he has
all the Wealth of the Nation in his Coffers; ſo that there is a neceſſity
he ſhould have as extravagant and incredible ways of expending it, that it
may have its due circulation amongſt the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:61013:115"/>But when this vaſt Wealth and Power is
turned to the Diſturbance and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Mankind, it is terrible; and
yet it hath its uſe too: We and all <hi>Europe</hi> have been taught, by the
Induſtry of this great King, mighty Improvements in War; ſo that
<hi>Europe</hi> has been theſe 12 years an Over-match for the <hi>Turk;</hi>
and we for <hi>France</hi> by the continuation of the War. The 40 Millions
<hi>Sterling</hi> which the late War hath, and will coſt <hi>England,</hi>
before all is paid, was well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, if it had been for no other end, than
to teach us the full uſe and practice of War; and in that Point to equal us
with our Neighbours.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved by <hi>Polybius</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
that wherever they met with an Enemy, that had better Weapons than
themſelves, they changed with them; This Docility gained them the Empire of
the World. On the contrary, thoſe late Eaſtern Tyrants have deſpiſed
Learning, and conſequently muſt ſubmit to the more refined Valour of
<hi>Europe.</hi> I ſay, the Effects of Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in War and
Peace, are Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> becauſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lords of the
People; far out-did the Commonwealth in Magnificent Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61013:116"/>both Publick and Private. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> left
<hi>Rome</hi> a Marble City, which he found of Brick only. <hi>Nero</hi> burnt
it and rebuilt it, and a <hi>Golden Palace</hi> for himſelf, like a City.
<hi>Veſpatian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> built Amphitheaters and Baths far
ſurpaſſing any Buildings now upon the face of the Earth; in one of which
120000 Perſons might ſee and hear, and be ſeated with more convenience,
than upon our Stages. <hi>Adrian</hi> viſited moſt parts of the World, on
purpoſe to build Cities. <hi>Trajan</hi> had his Name on every Wall, which he
either reſtored, or built. His Pillar and Bridge over the <hi>Danube</hi> are
Stupendious Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Expences.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Kings built them Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein they
ſlaved their whole Nation, and which are the Wonders of the World to this
day, the <hi>Obelisks</hi> I mean, and <hi>Pyramids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſiatick Emperours</hi> of <hi>China</hi> and
<hi>Japan</hi> have outdone the <hi>Europeans</hi> in this kind of immenſe
Buildings, as the Wall in <hi>China,</hi> the Cut Rivers and Sluces and Bridges
there. In <hi>Japan</hi> the Buildings are no leſs incredibly great.</p>
               <p>Of this Abſolute Dominion we have Examples even in thoſe two
<hi>American</hi> Empires, of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru.</hi> In this
laſt, meer Nature forc't Impoſſibilities <pb n="219" facs="tcp:61013:116"/>without
Art, Tools, or Science. The <hi>Cuſco</hi> Fortreſs was a Maſter-piece,
where Stones were laid upon Stones, which no Engine of ours could carry, or
raiſe up; or Tools better poliſh, and fit together; where a Country near as
big as all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> was turned into a Garden, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated better
than <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and Water-Works brought to Play and overſpread
ſome thouſands of miles, where it never Rains. This was the only Arbitrary
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment well applied to the good of Mankind, I ever met with in Hiſtory;
where Roads and Store-houſes of Food and Raiment were the Guides, and
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the miles for the Travellers, and the whole Empire turned into an
uſeful and intelligible Map.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Turks, Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Mogul,</hi> the
whole Empire is intended ſolely for the Pleaſure of one Man; and here even
Tyranny it ſelf is foully abuſed.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſhould be loth to ſee them in any kind exemplified in
<hi>England.</hi> In our happy Iſland we ſee ſuch Palaces and Gardens, as
are for the Health and Eaſe of Man only; and what they want in Magnificence,
they have in Neatneſs. There is not ſuch a thing as a <hi>Gravel Walk</hi>
in or about <hi>Paris,</hi> nor a <hi>Rowler</hi> of any ſort; when it Rains
the Tuilleries <pb n="220" facs="tcp:61013:117"/>are ſhut up, and one walks in Dirt
ſome days after. The Graſs Plots, or, as they call them <hi>Bowling
Greens,</hi> are as ill kept, they clip them and beat them with flat Beaters as
they do their Walks. This puts me in mind of what I ſaw in the Garden of the
<hi>Prince of Conde</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> where there was a Graſſy Circle
of about 4 foot wide, round one of the Fountains in the middle of the Garden;
to keep this down, and make it of a finer Turf, the Gardner had Teathered two
<hi>Black Lambs,</hi> and two <hi>White Kids,</hi> at equal diſtances, which
fed upon it. What ever the effect was, I thought it lookt pretty enough; and
the little <hi>Animals</hi> were as Ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as the Graſs.</p>
               <p>All the Paintings and Prints made of late years of the King make
him look very old; which in my mind is not ſo; for he is plump in the Face,
and is well coloured, and ſeems healthy, and eats and drinks heartily, which
I ſaw him do; This is certainly an injury to him, and poſſibly in
complaiſance to the Dauphin, or worſe. This is the meaneſt Compliment I
have known the French guilty of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Prince; for there are every
where Expreſſions of an other nature all over <hi>Paris.</hi> See <hi>The
Deſcription of Paris,</hi> where they are collected and at large. 
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61013:117"/>The <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> (the
firſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter of that People, as this King is of the
<hi>French</hi>) had upon this Subject from the People a much finer thought,
and wiſh, <hi>De noſtris annis tibi Jupiter au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geat annos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However it be, the King ſeems not to like <hi>Verſailles</hi>
ſo well as he did; and has an Opinion, that the Air is not ſo good, as
elſewhere; he leaves it (as I ſaid) every week on <hi>Tueſday</hi> night,
and goes moſtly to <hi>Marli,</hi> or <hi>Meudon,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to
the <hi>Trianon,</hi> which is but at the end of the Gardens, and returns not
to <hi>Verſailles</hi> till <hi>Saturday</hi> night: Beſides his
extraordinary removes to <hi>Fontainbleau.</hi> I wonder no body puts him in
mind of that Paradiſe of <hi>France, Languedoc,</hi> where he may be with
eaſe in 4 days, at the Rate that Kings uſe to Travel. I had this
Diſcourſe at Table with one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducteurs to the Ambaſſadour at
<hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles;</hi> but he could not bear it, it being againſt the
Intereſt of all ſettled Courts to remove, though it were never ſo good
for their Princes Health. I remember but of one Inſtance in Hiſtory, and
that was <hi>Aurenzebe</hi> the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> who in his middle Age
fell deſperately ſick, and long languiſht at <hi>Labor;</hi> but took
Advice of ſome body about him, and went in <pb n="222" facs="tcp:61013:118"/>his own
Kingdom a progreſs of 1000 miles to <hi>Caſimire,</hi> a very mild and
tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Climate, where he recovered, and lived to almoſt a 100 years
old.</p>
               <p>The King now ſeldom or never Plays, but contents himſelf
ſometimes with look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; but he hath formerly been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and has
loſt great Sums. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>S.</hi> Rookt him of near a Million of
Livers at Baſſet, by putting falſe Cards upon him; but was impriſoned
and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht for it ſome years.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subsection">
               <p>Before I give over the Buſineſs of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and Countrey, I
will add ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, which ſeemed particular and new to me.</p>
               <p>In the Kitchin Gardens at and near <hi>Paris,</hi> are a great
number of <hi>Apricock Standards;</hi> but kept low; very full of Bloſſoms,
and good Bearers.</p>
               <p>They make a Conſerve of the Fruit; which I like above any of
their Wet Sweetmeats; it was made by cutting them into thin ſlices, and
throwing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Stone; which our People ſpare ſometimes, and leave in
the Fleſh intire, and ſpoils the Sweetmeat, and ſets it a fretting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:61013:118"/>They imploy the Stones in Brandy, and
diſtil them in Spirits.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>April</hi> we had ſtore of Sparagraſs,
but they were often ſo bitter, to me at leaſt, that there was little
pleaſure in eating them. 'Tis certain they were much worſe, than ours in
<hi>England</hi> in that particular. Which puts me in mind of the <hi>Wild
Sparagraſs,</hi> which grows plentifully with us on the <hi>Sea Coaſt</hi>
in <hi>Lincolnſhire.</hi> This is very fair to the Eye; yet no culture of our
Gardens, by often tranſplanting, could make it eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I fancy the
Sparagraſs recovers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its natural force in a warmer Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;
for the ſweet is as it were degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. If they would have them good here,
they muſt renew the Seed from <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Wild Sparagraſs of <hi>Languedoc</hi> is another Plant
called <hi>Corruda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I procured out of <hi>Languedoc</hi> a ſort of <hi>Praecox
Vine,</hi> about 50 Plants, by the <hi>Clermont</hi> Carrier; the which I gave
to Mr. <hi>London,</hi> our Kings Gardner, for my Lord Ambaſſador. This
Grape is White, very thin Skinn'd, and clear as a drop of Water; it is
uſually ripe at <hi>St. Johns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs</hi> in <hi>July</hi> at
<hi>Montpellier,</hi> where it is called <hi>Des <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:61013:119"/>There are alſo in this Town <hi>Praecox
Grapes,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Turnfort</hi> told me, in the Phyſick Garden; but
whether the ſame with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nies,</hi> I know not.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid they delight much in Figs in Pots or Caſes; but
here is another way of preſerving the Fig Trees ſet in the Ground, which is
much practiſed; and that is to lap, and tie them up in long Straw, from top
to bottom; for which they are placed at a little diſtance from the Walls.
This alſo is practiſed to ſuch Trees as ſtand in the middle of the
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre; they did not open them till Mid-<hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Exotic Trees, which the <hi>Pariſians</hi> moſt delight
in, for their Garden Walks, and for the Shade in their Courts, are the
<hi>Maroniers, or Horſe Cheſnuts,</hi> of which they have innumerable; for
the Fruit ripens very well here, and comes up of it ſelf. Alſo the
<hi>Acacia Rovini,</hi> which is very common, and makes pretty Alleys, and
which they <hi>lop and turn to Pollards, with good effect;</hi> but of theſe
laſt the Leaves are late in putting forth, it being the 15th of <hi>May</hi>
our Syle, when theſe Trees were ſcarce green.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 25, when I took my Leave of Monſieur
<hi>Valliant,</hi> I found him in his Flower Garden; he ſhewed me a Parcel 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61013:119"/>of <hi>Ranunculus</hi>'s, in full Flower, which he had
received but two years before from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> They were very
beautiful and rare, at leaſt ſuch as I had never ſeen; as pure White,
White and Green, White and Strip't with Carnation, Pure Carnation or
Roſe-colour, Strip't Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe he had ſold ſome a Piſtol a Root, and hoped in a
year or two to be more plentifully ſtock't with them, that he might afford
them cheaper. I did ſee afterwards a few of them in the Royal
<hi>Pipinerie,</hi> and alſo in the Seedſman's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Monſieur <hi>le
Febre;</hi> but both came from him.</p>
               <p>I alſo took notice of his Iron Cradles or Hoops over his Beds,
which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable, and to be made higher and lower, according to the height
and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Floors they were deſigned to cover. This, me-thoughts, was
far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the Inventions of Wooden Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and might with Sail-Cloths
and Mats well ſerve for a ſort of portable Green Houſe, to the leſs
tender Plants.</p>
               <p>I ſaw <hi>Le Febre</hi>'s Flower Garden <hi>May</hi> 9. The
Tulips were in their prime; indeed, he had a very large and plentiful
Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. The Panacheé or Strip't Tulips were many, and of great
variety. He <pb n="226" facs="tcp:61013:120"/>obſerved to me, that from his large and
numerous Beds of <hi>ſelf-flower'd</hi> Tulips, that is, of one colour, as
Red, Yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they expected yearly ſome Stript ones, which
<hi>if perfect,</hi> that is, ſtrip't in all the ſix Leaves, would but
doubtfully continue, and perhaps return to their former ſtate the next year;
but if they <hi>laboured,</hi> or did not finiſh the ſtripings of all the
ſix Leaves the firſt year, there were better hopes of their continuing in
that ſtate.</p>
               <p>Though I had no mind to deſcend into the <hi>Stone Pits,</hi>
which are like our Mines, Well-faſhion, and the Stones wound up with great
Wheels, to husband the Soil over them: Yet I went to <hi>Vanre,</hi> 3 miles
from the Town, which is a ridge of Hills that runs along to the
<hi>Obſervatoire.</hi> Here the Quarries are open on the ſide of the Hill,
as with us. In thoſe I obſerved 2 or 3 layers of Stone, 2 or 3 foot thick,
moſtly made up of Shells, or <hi>Stones in the faſhion of Shells.</hi>
Amongſt theſe Shell-ſtones the moſt remarkable for bigneſs was a
certain ſmooth and long <hi>Buccinum,</hi> tapering with very many ſpires.
I meaſured one whoſe firſt ſpire was 8 inches diameter, the full length
I could not ſo well come at; yet holding proportion with thoſe of the kind
which lay flat, and which we could ſee in their full length, it muſt have
been <pb n="227" facs="tcp:61013:120"/>a foot long at leaſt. There is no
<hi>Bucci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> in any of our Seas a quarter ſo big. Here are many of this
Species. Alſo other large Turbinated Stones, which come near ſome of the
<hi>Weſt-India</hi> Kinds of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic Shells,</hi> of which
<hi>Genus</hi> yet there are none in the <hi>European</hi> Seas.</p>
               <p>Theſe Layers of Stone mixt with Shell-figured bodies, are at
certain diſtances in the Rock, and other Rocks void of Shells
interpoſed.</p>
               <p>Fanciful Men may think what they pleaſe of this matter; ſure I
am, until the Hiſtory of Nature, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of Minerals and
Foſſils is better lookt into, and more accurately diſtinguiſht, all
Reaſoning is in vain. It is to be obſerved, where Men are moſt in the
dark, there Impudence reigns moſt, as upon this Subject: They are not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent fairly to diſſent, but to inſult every body elſe. In like
manner upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Mineral Waters; How many <hi>Scriblers</hi> have
there been, without any knowledge of Foſſils?</p>
               <p>I know not whether it be worth the not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but it ſhews the
Humour of the <hi>French,</hi> that I ſaw in ſome Country Towns near
<hi>Paris,</hi> the Church Wall near the top, had a two foot broad Mourning

            <p>I ſhall conclude, what I have to ſay further, with the Air of
<hi>Paris,</hi> and the State of Health and Phyſic there.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Air.</note>The <hi>Air</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> is
drier than that of <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding the greateſt part of
the City is placed in a dirty miry Level; The Muddy Banks of the River
<hi>Seine</hi> witneſs this; alſo the old <hi>Latin</hi> Name of <hi>Paris,
Lutetia;</hi> but ſome of them are unwilling to derive it from
<hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> though there are ſeveral other Towns in <hi>France,</hi>
formerly more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than it, of that very Name; but from the
<hi>Greek</hi> Original, as <hi>Tolon, Tolouſa,</hi> which in that Language
ſignifie <hi>Black Dirt.</hi> We have an undoubted Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
different Temper of the Air in our <hi>Philoſophic Tranſactions;</hi> where
it is demonſtrated, that there falls twice as much Rain in <hi>England,</hi>
as at <hi>Paris;</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters of both having carefully been kept, for ſo
many years, both here and in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this quantity of Rain with us, our Fields are much greener; and
it was a pleaſing ſurpriſe to me at my return, ſailing up the River of
<hi>Thames,</hi> to ſee our <pb n="229" facs="tcp:61013:121"/>green Fields and Paſtures
on every ſide; but we pay dearly for it, in Agues and Coughs, and Rheumatick
Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>The Winter was very rude and fierce, as was ever known in the Memory
of Man; The cold Winds very piercing; and the Common People walk the Streets
all in Mouffes, and Multitudes had little <hi>Braſs Kettles</hi> of Smallcoal
kindled, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their Arms; and yet you ſhould ſcarce hear any one
Cough.</p>
            <p>I never ſaw a Miſt at <hi>Paris</hi> in the 6 months I ſtaid
there, but one; though a very broad River runs through the middle of the City,
nor any very ſtrong Winds; but this may be accidental, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of
ſome one year by chance.</p>
            <p>We were very ſenſible by the 20th of <hi>February</hi> our
Style, though the Nights were cold, and the White Froſts great in the
Mornings, that the Sun at Noon had a much ſtronger force and heat, than with
us, at that time of the year.</p>
            <p>Another Argument, of the Dryneſs of the Air at <hi>Paris,</hi> we
had from the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Health; ſuch as were thick Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Cought
and Spit much, ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and the inſenſible perſpiration of the
Skin was ſo clear and free, that the Kidneys had little to do; ſo that it
was obſerved by moſt, that though we <pb n="230" facs="tcp:61013:122"/>drank pretty
freely of the thin Wines of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> yet they
never broke our ſleep to get ſhut of them; and that very little paſſed
that way in the morning.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, a ſign of the Drineſs and great goodneſs of the Air
of <hi>Paris</hi> is, the vaſt number of Iron Bars all over the City; which
yet are moſtly intire, and the leaſt decayed with Ruſt, I ever ſaw in
any place; whereas ours in <hi>London</hi> are all in a few years all over
ruſty, and miſerably eaten.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Water.</note>We were ſufficiently alarmed at
our firſt coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> with the unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs of the
<hi>River Water,</hi> and cautioned againſt drinking it; and yet it was
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible to avoid the bad effects of it, for within the month
two thirds of the Family fell into Fluxes, ſome into Dyſenteries, and
ſome very ill of it. The <hi>French</hi> that come out of other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Countreys ſuffer as well as the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. We were told boiling it was a
good Remedy to prevent its Griping Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but that is a meer Notion, for we
know Mineral Waters boiled have a ſtronger effect, and this quality can
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from nothing leſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:61013:122"/>The <hi>Well Waters</hi> here are much worſe
than the River Waters, becauſe more Mineral. But our ſafety was in the
Water brought from the <hi>Maiſon des Eaux,</hi> where the Aqueduct of
<hi>Arcueil</hi> empties it ſelf to ſerve the great Palaces and City
Fountains.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Dyſentery.</note>The Diſeaſe of the
<hi>Dyſentery</hi> being one of the moſt common in <hi>Paris,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hypopecou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana.</hi>
               </note>the moſt
celebrated Drug for its cure is now the <hi>Hypopecouana;</hi> though I never
once made uſe of it to any of our People, but cured them all as ſoon, and
as well with our uſual Remedies. Indeed they have great need of it here, for
the poorer ſort of People, through ill Diet, this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Herbs, are very
ſubject to it; This Root is ſaid to cure it with as much certainty, and as
readily, as the Jeſuits Powder an Ague; Of this moſt of the Phyſicians
and Apothecaries agreed. They give it in Powder from 10 grains to 40, which is
the largeſt Doſe. It moſt commonly Vomits, and ſometimes Purges, but
both gently. 'Tis ſold here from 20 to 50 Crowns a Pound. They divide it into
4 ſorts, according to its goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:61013:123"/> 
               <note place="margin">The Stone.</note>Another popular Diſeaſe here
is the <hi>Stone;</hi> and there are Men well practiſed in the Cutting for
it. There are alſo two Hoſpitals, where great numbers are cut yearly, as
<hi>La Charite,</hi> and <hi>Hoſtel-Dieu,</hi> in both of theſe there are
Wired Cheſts full of Stones cut from Human Bodies; and in the Cheſt of
<hi>La Charite</hi> is one, which exceeds all belief; it was cut from a Monk,
who died in the very Operation; it is as big as a Childs Head. It is but the
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del or Patern of the Stone which is kept in the Cheſt; which has this
Inſcription on it. 
<q>
                  <hi>Figure &amp; groſſeur de la pierre, peſant</hi> 51
<hi>ounces, qui font trois livres trois ounces, qui a eſté
tirée dans cet Hoſpital au mois de Juin</hi> 1690, <hi>&amp; que l'ou
conſerve dans le couvent de la Charité.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But that which I ſhall here moſt inſiſt upon is the <hi>new
way,</hi> practiſed by <hi>Pere Jaques,</hi> a Monk. About the 20th of
<hi>April</hi> he cut in the <hi>Hoſtel-Dieu</hi> 10 in leſs than an hours
time: The 3d day after, all were hearty and without pain but one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:61013:123"/>He cuts both by the grand and little Appareil;
in both he boldly thruſts in a broad Lancet or Stilleto into the middle of
the Muſcle of the Thigh near the <hi>Anus,</hi> till he joins the Catheter or
Staff, or the Stone betwixt his Fingers; then he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the inciſion of the
Blader in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Stone with a Silver <hi>Oval Hoop;</hi> if that
will not do, he thruſts in his 4 Fingers, and tears it wider; then with the
<hi>Ducks Bill</hi> he draws it out.</p>
            <p>I ſee him cut a ſecond time in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel-Dieu;</hi> and
he performed it upon 9 Perſons in 3 quarters of an hour, very dexterouſly.
He ſeemed to venture at all; and put me into ſome diſorder with the
cruelty of the Operation; and a ſtouter <hi>Engliſhman</hi> than my ſelf.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I viſited them all in their Beds, and found them more amazed, than
in pain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pere Jaques</hi> cut alſo his way in the other Hoſpital
<hi>La Charite,</hi> much about the ſame time, 11 at twice. Here Monſieur
<hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,</hi> the beſt of the Surgeons for this Operation now in
<hi>Paris,</hi> harangu'd againſt him before the Governors, who coldly
anſwered, they would be determined by the Event, which way was beſt.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:61013:124"/>
               <hi>Atque hac ratione Faeminis Calcúli
omnium facillimè exciduntur; nempe ſcalpello intra va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginam uteri in
veſicam adacto.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Of thoſe cut in <hi>La Charite</hi> one died; and being
diſſected, it was found he had his Bladder pierced in 4 or 5 places; alſo
the <hi>Muſeulus Pſous</hi> ſadly mangled; alſo the left
<hi>Veſiculae Seminales</hi> cut.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this, if this Method was well executed by a
Skilful Hand, it might be of good uſe to Mankind.</p>
            <p>This way of Cutting for the Stone, puts me in mind of what I
formerly writ and publiſht in the <hi>Phil. Tranſactions,</hi> about
Cutting above the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> in the Fund of the Bladder.</p>
            <p>Alſo of that Experiment of Cutting for the Stone of an Alderman of
<hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> in the <hi>Gluteus Major,</hi> he was twice cut in the
ſame place, and out-lived both. I ſaw the firſt Stone, which was very
large, and in ſome meaſure tranſparent, Cryſtal like. This Experiment
is Printed in Dr. <hi>Willies Scarborough Spaw,</hi> 14 years ago at leaſt,
and is a fair hint for this new Method.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:61013:124"/>Since my return I had a Letter from Mr.
<hi>Probie,</hi> a very Learned and Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous young Gentleman, who was
with me to ſee the Operation, that part relating to this Matter I ſhall
here tranſcribe. Indeed, I mightily longed for an Account of this Matter, the
ſucceſs of which I came away too ſoon to learn any thing for certain.</p>

                        <hi>PEre Jaque</hi>'s Reputation mightily ſlackens, out of
Forty five that he cut at the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel-Dieu,</hi> but ſixteen of them
ſurvive; and of Nineteen in the <hi>Charite,</hi> but eleven. He has
practiſed at the Hoſpitals at <hi>Lyons,</hi> but, 'tis ſaid, with
worſe ſucceſs than at <hi>Paris.</hi> I am ſenſible he has got
abundance of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which makes me very often queſtion, what I may hear
ſaid of him. Dr. <hi>Fagon,</hi> the Kings Phyſician, told Dr.
<hi>Turnfort,</hi> when he went to preſent his Book to him, that he had cut
Seven at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and that ſix of them are alive, and as well
as if never cut. The Perſon that died was ſo Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, that he was
not expected to live, and 'twas thought, if he had not been cut, he had not
lived ſo long: The Surgeons have a great mind to cry down the Man, though
they <pb n="236" facs="tcp:61013:125"/>practiſe his Method. For <hi>Marſhal</hi> has
ſince cut after <hi>Pere Jaque</hi>'s Manner, only with this difference, that
<hi>Marſhal</hi>'s <hi>Catheter</hi> was can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulated. <hi>Le Rue,</hi> the
ſecond Surgeon of the <hi>Charity Hoſpital</hi> cut after the old Manner,
at the ſame time when <hi>Marſhal</hi> cut <hi>Pere Jaque</hi>'s way, but
had not ſo good ſucceſs as <hi>Marſhal</hi> had; for all that
<hi>Marſhal</hi> cut are alive and very well, whereas the other loſt one or

               <note place="margin">Phyſicians.</note>I had the opportunity of
Converſing with many of the Phyſicians in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; who all agree in the
low Condition and Diſeſteem it was in, from the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Confidence and
intruding of Quacks, Women, and Monks. Monſieur <hi>d'Achin,</hi> the late
chief Phyſician, has been ill thought on for taking Money, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
protection to theſe ſort of Cattle; but the chief Phyſician now,
Monſieur <hi>Fagon,</hi> is a Man of great Honour and Learning, and very
deſirous to promote the Art.</p>
            <p>It is here as with us, ſome practiſe out of meer vanity, others
to make a Penny any way to get Bread. The cauſe of all <pb n="240" facs="tcp:61013:127"/>this is, I think, the great Confidence People have of their own
Skill, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance without thinking. To paſs a Judgment upon Cures, and the
good and evil practice of Phyſick, without doubt is one of the niceſt
things, even to Men of the Faculty; but a Jury, that is, the very ordinary Men
in <hi>England,</hi> are ſuffered now to undertake the Queſtion; when I may
truly ſay, that I have ever found, no diſparagement to them, the moſt
Learned Men of the Nation, the moſt miſtaken in theſe Matters; and can it
be otherwiſe in ſo Conjectural an Art, when we our ſelves ſcarce know,
when we have done ill or well.</p>
            <p>Another cauſe of the low Eſteem of Phyſick here, are the
ſorry Fees that are given to Phyſicians; which makes that Science not worth
the Application and Study. The King indeed is very liberal, as in all things
elſe, in his Penſions to his chief Phyſician, and gives his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
good Preferments.</p>
            <p>Alſo Mr. <hi>Burdelot,</hi> who is alſo well Penſioned, and
lodged at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to the Dutcheſs of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> a Learned Man; he is perfectly well Skill'd in the Hiſtory
of Phyſick; and we may ſhortly (as he told me) expect from him, another
Supplement to <hi>Vauder Linden,</hi> of <pb n="241" facs="tcp:61013:127"/>many thouſand
Volumes, which have eſcaped that Catalogue, and are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for.</p>
            <p>Monſieur, and the Dauphin, and all the Princes of the Blood, have

            <p>Others have the practice of Nunneries and Convents, which gives them
Bread; others have Pariſhes; and ſome ſuch Shifts they make; but all is
wrong with them, and very little incouragement given to the Faculty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 14. the <hi>Prince of Conty</hi> ſent his Gentleman
and Coach at mid-night to fetch me to his Son, and to bring with me the late
King <hi>Charles's Drops</hi> to give him. This was a very haſty call. I told
the Meſſenger, I was the Prince's very humble Servant; but for any Drops or
other Medicines I had brought nothing at all with me, and had uſed only
ſuch as I found in their Shops, for all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions I had had to uſe
any. I deſired he would tell him, that I was ready to Conſult with his
Phyſicians upon his Sons Sickneſs, if he pleaſed to command me, 
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61013:128"/>but for coming upon any other Account I deſired to be
excuſed; but I heard no more of the Matter, and the young Prince died. By
this it is evident, there is as falſe a Notion of Phyſick in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as with us; and that it is here alſo thought a Knack, more than a Science or
Method; and little Chimical Toys, the Bijous of Quacks, are mightily in
requeſt. This Hereſie hath poſſeſſed the moſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well
as the ignorant part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and for this we are beholden to the late vain
Expoſitors of Nature, who have mightily inveighed againſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued
the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Phyſicians, in whoſe Works only this Art is to
be learnt, unleſs ſingle Perſons could live over as many Ages, as thoſe
Wiſe Men did.</p>
            <p>Men are apt to preſcribe to their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, before he can
poſſibly tell, what he ſhall in his Judgment think fitting to give; 'tis
well if this was in Negatives only; but they are prejudiced by the impertinence
of the Age, and <hi>our Men,</hi> who ought to Converſe with the Patient and
his Relations with Prognoſticks only, which are the honour of Phyſick, and
not play the Philoſopher by fanciful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Interpretations of the
Nature of Diſeaſes and Medicines, to gain a ſort of <pb n="243" facs="tcp:61013:128"/>Credit with the Ignorant; and ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are all thoſe that
have not ſtudied Phyſick thoroughly, and in earneſt.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Drops were deſired of me by other Perſons of Quality, as
the Princeſs <hi>d'Eſpinoy,</hi> the Ducheſs of <hi>Boullon,</hi>
Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Seſac, &amp;c.</hi> and having bethought my ſelf how my
Maſter, the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> had communicated them to me, and
ſhewed me very obligingly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs himſelf, by carrying me alone with
him into his Elaboratory at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> while it was Diſtilling.
Alſo Mr. <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> another time ſhewed me the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for the
Drops in his Appartment newly brought in, in great quantity, that is, <hi>Raw
Silk.</hi> I cauſed the Drops to be made here. Alſo I put Dr.
<hi>Turnfort</hi> upon making of them; which he did in perfection, by
Diſtilling the fineſt Raw Silk he could get. For my part I was
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at the Experiment often repeated, having never tried it before.
One Pound of Raw Silk yielded an incredible quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Volatil Salt, and in
proportion the fineſt Spirit I ever taſted; and that which recommends it
is, that it is when rectified, of a far more pleaſant ſmell, than that
which comes from Sal Armoniack or Hartſhorne; and the Salt refined and
cohobated with any well ſcented Chimical Oil, makes the <pb n="244" facs="tcp:61013:129"/>
               <hi>Kings Salt,</hi> as its us'd to be called. This my Lord
Ambaſſador gave me leave to preſent in his Name; and the Doctor now
ſupplies thoſe which want. Silk, indeed is nothing elſe, but a dry Jelly
from the Inſect Kind, and therefore very Cordial and Stomachick no doubt. The
<hi>Arabians</hi> were wiſe, and knowing in the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> to
have put it in their <hi>Alkermes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This muſt be ſaid for the Honour of this King, that he has ever
given great Encouragements for uſeful Diſcoveries in all Kinds, and
particularly in Phyſick. 'Tis well known he bought the Secret of the
Jeſuits Powder, and made it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; as he lately did that of the
<hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Conclude, it was my good Fortune here to have a Bundle of
Original Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Sir <hi>Theodore Mayerne,</hi> and his Friends, who
Correſponded with him, preſented me by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Wickar,</hi>
Dean of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who Marrying his Kinſwoman found them
amongſt other Writings of Law Matters. I have not yet had the leiſure to
peruſe them, but thoſe who know the Worth of that great Man, will deſire
they may be made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; which if they are, they ſhall come <pb facs="tcp:61013:132"/> 
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:61013:132"/>forth intire, and not diſguiſed, as ſome of his
other Papers have been, to the great detriment of Phyſick; and I think it is
the firſt Example of this Nature, that Poſthumous Papers were ever
abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated, and made what they never were, before an intire and full
publication.</p>
